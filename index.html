  <h3>Congrats to our colleague Dwayne Dixon on returning to the classroom!</h3>
<p>Read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eLrb98o3HLmJCvqymd7aW6bzGBPXyJHtNcxKBSsMyjk/edit?tab=t.0">Professor Dixon’s
statement</a>
and <a href="https://unc-ch-aaup.org/assets/unc-ch-aaup-statement-on-dwayne-dixon.pdf">our statement calling for his
reinstatement</a>.</p>
<h3>AAUP Press Conference @ UNC: Wednesday, Oct. 8, 11am</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, October 8 at 11am, we will gather outside UNC’s South
Building, where AAUP officers along with UNC students will speak to
the press, make some announcements, and then walk to New West with
Professor Dwayne Dixon and his students. They’ll be returning to class
for the first time since September 29, when Professor Dixon was
<a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2025/10/breaking-university-dwayne-dixon-reinstated">wrongfully and harmfully placed on administrative
leave</a>. On
Friday, October 3, the administration <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2025/10/03/unc-professor-dwayne-dixon-reinstated-after-suspension-over-anti-fascist-ties/">finally reinstated
Dixon</a>
after significant pressure from the community, including AAUP NC,
AAUP-Chapel Hill, UNC’s YDSA, UE-150, the ACLU of NC, and many of
Dixon’s admiring colleagues and students.</p>
<p>We’ll be cheering their return but also using this moment to lay out,
for faculty and the public, the many issues caused by UNC-Chapel
Hill’s administration’s egregious attacks on faculty and students’
academic freedom and First Amendment rights—not just last week’s
unnecessary and painful disruption of the fall semester for 300+
students, but also the <a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/aaup-president-calls-explanation-unc-chapel-hill-tenure-delay">harmful tenure vote delay for 33 faculty
members at UNC in
May</a>
and the <a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2025/08/university-hanes-palestinian-art-exhibit-covered-up">illegal removal and destruction of a student-created,
faculty-approved pro-Palestinian mural in
August</a>.</p>
<h3>Meet-up at Namu: Tuesday, Oct. 14, 4:30–6:30pm</h3>
<p>We’re gathering to celebrate our recently promoted and tenured
colleagues—and to raise a glass to our important collective wins:
fighting tenure delays, showing up for students’ freedom of speech,
and organizing to defend academic freedom—we have a lot to celebrate!
Join us at <a href="https://www.namudurham.com/">Namu</a> for conversations and
collegiality, and please invite your UNC colleagues.</p>
<h3>Academic Freedom Resources</h3>
<p>Please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNLxqqVUcNQ8XIU7tRk2iAZcNX2GlNr_NZBcJGwTanrPnK0g/viewform">this
form</a>
to report any incidents of attacks on academic freedom or harassment
of academic workers since August 2025. This form is confidential and
will only be seen by officers and organizers for the NC AAUP.</p>
<h3>Conversation with Former Provost Chris Clemens, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2pm</h3>
<p>The Administration of Free Speech: A TransparUNCy Conversation with
Former Provost Chris Clemens, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2pm, Carroll Hall.</p>
<p>For this year’s First Amendment Day, TransparUNCy will be joined by
former Provost Chris Clemens for a discussion about some of the most
contentious conflicts in higher education and their implications for
free speech. How do debates around DEI, “institutional neutrality,”
student protest, tenure, and the ongoing politicization of university
governance affect the conditions for free speech on our campus?</p>

<h3>CITAP First Amendment Event at UNC, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2:45–3:45pm</h3>
<p>CITAP First Amendment Event at UNC, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2:45–3:45pm, Carroll Hall</p>
<p><a href="https://medialaw.unc.edu/events/citap1a_day_2025/">https://medialaw.unc.edu/events/citap1a_day_2025/</a></p>
<p>In collaboration with the What’s at Stake project
<a href="https://www.onthestakes.com/">https://www.onthestakes.com/</a>, join this timely discussion on the
role of First Amendment freedoms in protecting democracy.</p>
<p>The United States is backsliding into what political scientists call
“electoral autocracy,” where elections are held but there is not free
and fair competition. The President and his party are weaponizing the
state to weaken the political opposition and the journalism outlets,
media, platforms, and universities that can hold them accountable,
including through elections. At such a moment, the First Amendment
freedom to produce information and knowledge in the public interest
that safeguards democratic elections, processes, and norms is
crucial. This panel will provide a clear-eyed, research-based analysis
of what is at stake and argue for the right—and responsibility—of
media and platforms to serve as democratic gatekeepers and hold
elected leaders accountable for eroding checks on their power. At a
time when many university administrators and faculty would rather talk
about the hypothetical threats of AI than the wolves at the door,
panelists will detail the urgency of the existential threats to our
shared democratic life, the violent consequences of inaction such as
during the attempted coup on January 6th, and the ways that
journalism, platforms, and universities must rise to meet the moment
and fulfill their obligation of serving the public interest.</p>

  <p>AAUP NC and UNC-Chapel Hill AAUP condemn the egregious violation of

freedom</a>.</p>

  <p>On the night before the start of Fall 2025 semester, facilities
workers at UNC-Chapel Hill boarded over and subsequently removed a
student- and community-created mural in Hanes Art Center. The mural
was initiated and created by several students in the undergraduate
course Studio Art 490: Art as Social Action, with help from other
students across campus. No Art Department faculty were consulted
before the mural was covered and removed, and no one has taken
responsibility for this censorship.</p>
<p>The American Association of University Professors North Carolina and
the UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP call on Chancellor Lee Roberts
and Interim Provost Jim Dean to restore the mural and publicly explain
how the decision to remove it was made and by whom.</p>
<p>See the full <a href="/assets/unc-ch-aaup-statement-on-mural-censorship.pdf">UNC-CH AAUP statement on mural censorship at
UNC</a>.</p>
<p>AAUP North Carolina and the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of AAUP stand in
solidarity with the professors and students whose academic freedom and
free speech rights were violated by the cover-up, removal, and
destruction of the student-created mural &quot;I told you I loved you (Gaza
Solidarity).&quot;</p>
<p>The campus community is invited to print T-shirts and posters bearing
the quote from poet June Jordan that appears prominently on the mural:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I told you I loved you and I wanted genocide to stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meet outside Hanes Art Center, where the mural was located, at 3pm on
Wednesday, September 3. Bring a blank t-shirt if you&#39;d like to
screenprint.</p>
