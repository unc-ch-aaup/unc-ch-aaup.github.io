  <p>The UNC-Chapel Hill Chapter of AAUP opposes classroom recording for
any reason without the instructor’s consent. We were shocked to learn
on Monday February 9th that the Interim Provost had drafted a new
policy allowing the recording of classes to go into effect on Monday
February 16th.</p>

  <h3>Academic Freedom Code for UNC System</h3>
<p>Last week the UNC System Board of Governors &quot;<a href="https://www.wunc.org/education/2026-01-28/nc-professors-fear-new-academic-freedom-policy-censor-faculty">unanimously approved the
System&#39;s academic freedom
definition</a>,&quot;
which seeks to set
&quot;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2026/01/29/unc-plans-define-what-academic-freedom-and-isnt">limits</a>&quot;
on academic freedom, and put it forward for a binding vote at their
next meeting on Feb. 25th. The NC AAUP&#39;s Syllabus Committee (including
members from our chapter) will communicate a statewide strategy in
advance of the BoG mtg.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5uv1atZ6xoUiToNH_UcvswTWsXmB1prhZDZo1fif80/edit?tab=t.0">the proposed revised
policy</a>. Be
sure to note the &quot;system suggestions in red.&quot;</p>
<p>See the <a href="/assets/letter-re-proposed-changes-to-academic-freedom-code-2026-01-26.pdf">letter from AAUP&#39;s
lawyers</a>
to the UNC System about the proposed policy revisions. <strong>Please
circulate this letter widely.</strong></p>
<h3>Syllabus Requests</h3>
<p><strong>If you receive a public records request for a syllabus, please share
it -- and any subsequent correspondence -- with the NC AAUP hotline at
<a href="https://www.aaupnc.org/projects/providing-legal-support">https://www.aaupnc.org/projects/providing-legal-support</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The hotline can confidentially provide support and first-line legal
advice. Compiling as much info as possible will also help us build a
legal case against the UNC system and the syllabus policy.</p>
<p><strong>Please also continue to share with colleagues the NC AAUP&#39;s
&quot;<a href="https://www.aaupnc.org/projects/guidance-for-syllabi">Guidelines for
Syllabi</a>,&quot; and
encourage them to share with the hotline any requests they receive.</strong></p>
<h3>Duke AAUP Cut the Cuts Rally</h3>
<h4>Friday Feb. 6th, 4:30pm, Duke East Campus</h4>
<p>UNC CH AAUP, UE150, and TransparUNCy are collaborating with Duke and
several other organizations for a Durham-based Cut the Cuts
rally. This is an opportunity for cross institutional solidarity in
the face of ideological cuts to staff and services at public and
private universities. (Following our lead, our AAUP colleagues at Duke
commissioned their own independent audit). Please consider joining
this Friday, February 6th at Trinity Park in Durham, 4:30 pm. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ExcLLP89V1BA8P2yHY63dD1Ndoi4m5d/view">More

be involved, please email Rosie Miesner:

<p>Several of our chapter members are participating in the <strong>National
AAUP &quot;Organize Every Campus&quot; training in February 2026.</strong> If you are
looking for ways to join other colleagues to more effectively resist

violence and harassment, this training could be for you!</p>

<strong>Mondays and Wednesdays, February 2, 4, 9, 11 and 18, from 6:30
PM-8:30 PM ET</strong>. Participants are expected to attend the entire

April elections. Search your UNC inbox for &quot;Reminder to take the
Faculty Governance Interest Survey.&quot;</p>
