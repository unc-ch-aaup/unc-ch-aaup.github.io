      UNC academic programs and centers threatened<br>
      while SCiLL’s funding soars
    </h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    In the 2024–2025 academic year, the School of Civic Life and
    Leadership (SCiLL) established a record that should cause embarrassment
    to UNC’s leaders. Of the nine Chapel Hill faculty initially brought on
    board to staff the SCiLL, at least six have already resigned, citing
    defective leadership, mission drift, and shocking procedural
    irregularities.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the many faculty who decried the imposition on our campus of a
    redundant and expensive program designed to be peopled and partly funded
    by right-wing think tanks pursuing pet political objectives, SCiLL’s
    roll-out was hard to witness. But its continued existence is much worse.
    Not merely a bureaucratic trainwreck, the SCiLL is intellectually
    deficient and represents a gross political incursion into the curricular
    operations of our campus.
  </p>
  <p>
    One departing member of the SCiLL, economics professor Jon Williams,
    recently called the School an “unmitigated disaster.” It is
    characterized, he said, by “incivility and dysfunction, biased and
    unfair processes, a complete disregard for governance, and a willingness
    to deceive and misrepresent that is unlike anything I’ve witnessed in my
    15 years in academia.” English professor Inger Brodey, who served as an
    associate dean at the School, explained her resignation to the <em>Daily
      Tar Heel</em> by noting that the “SCiLL is currently the least civil
    department” she is aware of on this campus, which is quite the
    achievement for a School ostensibly devoted to civil discourse.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite its record of betrayal and dysfunction, however,
    <strong>SCiLL continues to fail upwards</strong>. N. C. Senate Bill 257
    proposes pouring millions more into SCiLL while mandating cuts to “low
    enrollment” programs at Chapel Hill and across the UNC system.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Some facts all UNC faculty should know:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>SCiLL’s touted “Courageous Conversations” course on Israel-Palestine
      was led by a faculty member with no expertise in the subject; paid for
      weekly travel to UNC for non-academic “guest speakers”; required
      students to apply and be vetted in order to enroll; and purportedly cost
      $500,000.</p></p></li>
    <li><p>The proposed budget, now under consideration in the House, would
      remove the SCiLL from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and eliminate
      oversight by the Provost—the university’s chief academic officer.</p></li>
    <li><p>The budget specifies that by 2025–2026 the SCiLL should employ “at
      least twenty” tenured faculty hired from outside UNC-Chapel Hill.</p></li>
    <li><p>The budget prohibits any further joint or adjunct appointments
      involving Chapel Hill faculty until the hiring of those twenty or more
      non-UNC people.</p></li>
    <li><p>The expansion of the SCiLL, and the legislature’s careful design to
      exclude current Chapel Hill faculty from planning and decision-making,
      comes even as other programs <em>actually created by faculty and staffed
        by scholars with genuine disciplinary expertise</em> will probably be
      placed on the chopping block.</p></li>
    <li><p>These draconian cuts would involve “for <em>each year</em> [emphasis
      added] of the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium” $33.6 million in spending
      reductions to Centers and Institutes across the UNC system. In addition,
      in the fiscal year 2026–2027, $20 million will be cut from
      “low-performing” academic programs “or other curriculum” across the
      system, excluding the already-ravaged Greensboro and Asheville campuses.
      (See SB 257, page 126.)</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If SCiLL—poised to become larger and even less accountable—continues
    on its current trajectory, it will become an albatross that will
    transform UNC from arguably the best public University in the nation
    into a second-rate state school.

    <strong>UNC leaders must push back.</strong>
