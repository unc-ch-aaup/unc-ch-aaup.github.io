        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Congrats to our colleague Dwayne Dixon on returning to the classroom!</h3>
<p>Read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eLrb98o3HLmJCvqymd7aW6bzGBPXyJHtNcxKBSsMyjk/edit?tab=t.0">Professor Dixon’s
statement</a>
and <a href="https://unc-ch-aaup.org/assets/unc-ch-aaup-statement-on-dwayne-dixon.pdf">our statement calling for his
reinstatement</a>.</p>
<h3>AAUP Press Conference @ UNC: Wednesday, Oct. 8, 11am</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, October 8 at 11am, we will gather outside UNC’s South
Building, where AAUP officers along with UNC students will speak to
the press, make some announcements, and then walk to New West with
Professor Dwayne Dixon and his students. They’ll be returning to class
for the first time since September 29, when Professor Dixon was
<a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2025/10/breaking-university-dwayne-dixon-reinstated">wrongfully and harmfully placed on administrative
leave</a>. On
Friday, October 3, the administration <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2025/10/03/unc-professor-dwayne-dixon-reinstated-after-suspension-over-anti-fascist-ties/">finally reinstated
Dixon</a>
after significant pressure from the community, including AAUP NC,
AAUP-Chapel Hill, UNC’s YDSA, UE-150, the ACLU of NC, and many of
Dixon’s admiring colleagues and students.</p>
<p>We’ll be cheering their return but also using this moment to lay out,
for faculty and the public, the many issues caused by UNC-Chapel
Hill’s administration’s egregious attacks on faculty and students’
academic freedom and First Amendment rights—not just last week’s
unnecessary and painful disruption of the fall semester for 300+
students, but also the <a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/aaup-president-calls-explanation-unc-chapel-hill-tenure-delay">harmful tenure vote delay for 33 faculty
members at UNC in
May</a>
and the <a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2025/08/university-hanes-palestinian-art-exhibit-covered-up">illegal removal and destruction of a student-created,
faculty-approved pro-Palestinian mural in
August</a>.</p>
<h3>Meet-up at Namu: Tuesday, Oct. 14, 4:30–6:30pm</h3>
<p>We’re gathering to celebrate our recently promoted and tenured
colleagues—and to raise a glass to our important collective wins:
fighting tenure delays, showing up for students’ freedom of speech,
and organizing to defend academic freedom—we have a lot to celebrate!
Join us at <a href="https://www.namudurham.com/">Namu</a> for conversations and
collegiality, and please invite your UNC colleagues.</p>

<h3>Conversation with Former Provost Chris Clemens, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2pm</h3>
<p>The Administration of Free Speech: A TransparUNCy Conversation with
Former Provost Chris Clemens, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2pm, Carroll Hall.</p>
<p>For this year’s First Amendment Day, TransparUNCy will be joined by
former Provost Chris Clemens for a discussion about some of the most
contentious conflicts in higher education and their implications for
free speech. How do debates around DEI, “institutional neutrality,”
student protest, tenure, and the ongoing politicization of university
governance affect the conditions for free speech on our campus?</p>

<h3>CITAP First Amendment Event at UNC, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2:45–3:45pm</h3>
<p>CITAP First Amendment Event at UNC, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2:45–3:45pm, Carroll Hall</p>
<p><a href="https://medialaw.unc.edu/events/citap1a_day_2025/">https://medialaw.unc.edu/events/citap1a_day_2025/</a></p>
<p>In collaboration with the What’s at Stake project
<a href="https://www.onthestakes.com/">https://www.onthestakes.com/</a>, join this timely discussion on the
role of First Amendment freedoms in protecting democracy.</p>
<p>The United States is backsliding into what political scientists call
“electoral autocracy,” where elections are held but there is not free
and fair competition. The President and his party are weaponizing the
state to weaken the political opposition and the journalism outlets,
media, platforms, and universities that can hold them accountable,
including through elections. At such a moment, the First Amendment
freedom to produce information and knowledge in the public interest
that safeguards democratic elections, processes, and norms is
crucial. This panel will provide a clear-eyed, research-based analysis
of what is at stake and argue for the right—and responsibility—of
media and platforms to serve as democratic gatekeepers and hold
elected leaders accountable for eroding checks on their power. At a
time when many university administrators and faculty would rather talk
about the hypothetical threats of AI than the wolves at the door,
panelists will detail the urgency of the existential threats to our
shared democratic life, the violent consequences of inaction such as
during the attempted coup on January 6th, and the ways that
journalism, platforms, and universities must rise to meet the moment
and fulfill their obligation of serving the public interest.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the night before the start of Fall 2025 semester, facilities
workers at UNC-Chapel Hill boarded over and subsequently removed a
student- and community-created mural in Hanes Art Center. The mural
was initiated and created by several students in the undergraduate
course Studio Art 490: Art as Social Action, with help from other
students across campus. No Art Department faculty were consulted
before the mural was covered and removed, and no one has taken
responsibility for this censorship.</p>
<p>The American Association of University Professors North Carolina and
the UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP call on Chancellor Lee Roberts
and Interim Provost Jim Dean to restore the mural and publicly explain
how the decision to remove it was made and by whom.</p>
<p>See the full <a href="/assets/unc-ch-aaup-statement-on-mural-censorship.pdf">UNC-CH AAUP statement on mural censorship at
UNC</a>.</p>
<p>AAUP North Carolina and the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of AAUP stand in
solidarity with the professors and students whose academic freedom and
free speech rights were violated by the cover-up, removal, and
destruction of the student-created mural &quot;I told you I loved you (Gaza
Solidarity).&quot;</p>
<p>The campus community is invited to print T-shirts and posters bearing
the quote from poet June Jordan that appears prominently on the mural:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I told you I loved you and I wanted genocide to stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meet outside Hanes Art Center, where the mural was located, at 3pm on
Wednesday, September 3. Bring a blank t-shirt if you&#39;d like to
screenprint.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the 2024–2025 academic year, the School of Civic Life and
Leadership (SCiLL) established a record that should cause
embarrassment to UNC’s leaders. Of the nine Chapel Hill faculty
initially brought on board to staff the SCiLL, at least six have
already resigned, citing defective leadership, mission drift, and
shocking procedural irregularities.</p>
<p>The expansion of SCiLL and the legislature’s design to exclude current
UNC-CH faculty from planning and decision-making comes as other
programs <em>actually created by faculty and staffed by scholars with
genuine disciplinary expertise</em> will probably be placed on the
chopping block.</p>

congratulated the thirty-three faculty members in the College of Arts

<p>Wolfson notes that the state of academic freedom and faculty
governance at North Carolina’s flagship school, the first public
university in the United States, is now in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thirteen-member UNC–Chapel Hill Board of Trustees … has
significant work to do to repair the damage to academic freedom and
the reputation of the university. Faculty members and their
departments, who expected a transparent and honest tenure review,
deserve answers to their questions: Why didn’t the board approve
these faculty members in March? Why were humanities, social
sciences, and professional school faculty targeted? What will be
done to ensure this kind of delay does not happen again?</p>

        <link href="https://unc-ch-aaup.org/news#2025-04-11"/>
        <updated>2025-04-11T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>The UNC-CH chapter of the AAUP strongly and unequivocally condemns the
targeting of international students and scholars.</strong></p>
<p>In light of the April 8 <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article303778476.html">revocation of six UNC student visas</a>, we
call on UNC-CH to take concrete steps to support students and scholars
at risk. At a moment when the future of higher education and free
speech are in peril, our institution has obligations beyond doing no
harm. If we fail to protect international students and scholars, we
jeopardize the safety and academic freedom of all students and
scholars and the integrity of the university as a whole.</p>
<p>We therefore make the following demands of UNC-CH’s leaders:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain enrollment and allow continued study and resource access
for our international students and scholars whose visas have been
unjustly revoked.</li>
<li>Provide and pay for legal counsel for those students and scholars
whose visas have been revoked.</li>
<li>Work swiftly and affirmatively—through lawsuits, if necessary—to
stop further termination-without-due-process of legal statuses of
students and scholars.</li>
<li>Allow international students and scholars to continue their
studies, research, and paid work, including teaching and research
assistantships and fellowships, remotely.</li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/2025.04.07-AAUP-Letter-to-GCs-corrected.pdf">AAUP’s guidelines for general counsels</a> to protect
student information.</li>
<li>Avoid voluntary cooperation or information-sharing with Immigration
and Customs Enforcement, other federal agencies charged with
investigating students’ and scholars’ protected speech, revoking
visas, and/or facilitating deportations.</li>
<li>Provide immediate notification to students and scholars of any
changes in their legal statuses and share reliable information in a
timely fashion with all international students and scholars.</li>

        <id>https://unc-ch-aaup.org/news#2025-04-03</id>
        <link href="https://unc-ch-aaup.org/news#2025-04-03"/>
        <updated>2025-04-03T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, 3/27/25 the UNC AAUP held a hybrid meeting for concerned
members of the UNC community (AAUP member or not) about the current
attacks on higher education. While there were suggested topics of
conversation, the attendees focused on how to be proactive in
protecting UNC community members from ICE raids.</p>
<h4>Invited guests</h4>
<p>AAUP Vice-President Rotua Lumbantobing and Osamudia James, UNC Law
Professor and co-signer of <a href="https://app.box.com/s/2me4mszr6p4oinnucw8i4jmb8d7570kp">this
memo</a> to
university OGCs explaining the lawfulness of DEI programs. (VP
Lumbantobing was unable to join via zoom.)</p>
<h4>Summary of key next steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Two working groups formed, focused on “Information and Resources”
and “Emergency Support” for students, faculty and staff
at-risk. Email <a href="mailto:mwpalm@gmail.com">mwpalm@gmail.com</a> to join either.</li>
<li>Most immediately, attendees wanted <strong>clarity from the university</strong>
about what counts <strong>as private space</strong> on campus that ICE agents
can’t enter without a warrant. The Faculty Senate has already raised
this issue but hasn’t gotten a clear answer.</li>
<li>Share best practices for keeping UNC community members safe from ICE
and other forces of policing on campus</li>
<li>Create a way to keep in touch with members who attended the
meeting. Email <a href="mailto:info@unc-ch-aaup.org">info@unc-ch-aaup.org</a> if you want to join or organize
a task force or if you want to join the UNC Chapter of the
AAUP. Email Michael Palm, <a href="mailto:mwpalm@gmail.com">mwpalm@gmail.com</a>, if you want to be on the
AAUP listserv. You don’t have to be a member of the AAUP to be on
the listserv.</li>
<li>Join with other local organizations, like
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/transparuncy/">TransparUNCy</a> (undergrad
activist group worth following) and <a href="https://www.workersunionunc.com/">UE Local
150</a>, which are advocating for
similar causes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have to support one another to stay vocal and co-create the
leadership and community we are seeking.</p>
<p>We need to both donate to and show up for local chapters of groups
like NAACP, Men for Racial Justice, and other grassroots community
groups.</p>
<h4>Questions and answers</h4>
<h5>Q1. Why join the AAUP?</h5>
<ul>
<li>AAUP files lawsuits that defend higher education and protect faculty</li>
<li>AAUP protects academic freedom. <a href="https://www.aaup.org/about/history-aaup">The organization was founded in
1915 to define and defend academic freedom, a role it continues to
play</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: State law prohibits North Carolina employees from
collective bargaining, giving state employees fewer rights and
protections than most other states. However, we do have the right to
unionize.</li>
<li>AAUP protects promotion and tenure rights through its <a href="https://www.aaup.org/about/committees">Committee on
Academic Freedom and Tenure (Committee
A)</a> and <a href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure/resources-tenure">the policies it has
affirmed dating back to its founding in
1915</a>.</li>
<li>The AAUP and professional organizations are providing leadership
right now that the university isn’t.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: The dues to join are expensive but 1. You can pay in
monthly installments and 2. The national AAUP gives a lot of money
back to the state AAUP to use locally.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q2. Who, if anyone, is organizing with staff?</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.workersunionunc.com/">UE Local 150</a> is the union for
staff at UNC and graduate student workers. Staff members often
attend meetings that faculty organize. Not sure about grad student
workers.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Staff are particularly vulnerable, especially if their
positions are dependent on grants.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q3. What are other tactics can we use besides filing lawsuits to resist the attack on higher education?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Join the planned <strong>Days of Action</strong> organized by the AAUP<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.killthecuts.org/">April 8</a> Day of Action: Kill the Cuts</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dayofactionforhighered.org/">April 17</a> Day of Action
for Higher Ed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share collectively sourced information about best practices that
been effective in defending our rights</li>
<li>Compile and share information about which federal grants have been
cut at so that we can raise awareness about the harms the cuts have
caused and gauge the extent of the cuts. <strong>To do: Create a local to
UNC list of cancelled grants to supplement what’s already
available. Can be crowdsourced.</strong><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sssp1.org/index.cfm/pageid/2626?fbclid=IwY2xjawJT2wVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHbeQkXOi4Ae0KYqtdAzJeNzaDRTlwreejsYpmxD38LB9STxzArzV5Dvvmw_aem_LSTQjpZeSgDfFW8oOFnyeA">Here are guidelines about what to do if your federal grant is
ended</a></li>
<li><a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf">Here is a report from Department of Health and Human Services and
the NIH listing grants that have been terminated as of
3/21/25</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q4. What can do to protect people targeted by ICE, especially immigrants and other people with precarious citizenship status? Relatedly, how do we protect rights of protestors?</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mesana.org/resources-and-opportunities/2025/03/21/trumps-immigration-actions-what-to-know-webinar">AAUP and the Middle East Studies Association (MESA) had a know
 your rights webinar on
 3-27-25</a></li>
<li>When talking to UNC administration or with ICE agents, emphasize
your Fourth Amendment Right to be protected from unreasonable search
and seizure. Stand up for other people if you see them being
attacked by ICE.</li>
<li>Get trained by Siembra NC about how to protect people from ICE
raids. Go to a training, join or volunteer at Siembra, and <a href="https://defendandrecruit.org/">download
this playbook</a> from them about what
to do defend immigrants. Also helpful: <a href="https://righttobe.org/events/bystander-intervention-to-support-the-immigrant-community-3/">Upstander
Training.</a></li>
<li>Federal law says that ICE can’t enter <strong>private spaces</strong> without a
judicial warrant signed by a judge. So far, UNC has established that
dorms are private spaces that ICE can’t enter without a warrant if
the entry is locked. <strong>To do</strong>: Get UNC to define what other spaces
on campus count as private spaces. For instance, offices seem like
they should be considered private spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q5. What is the AAUP and other members of campus doing to protect grad students of color who are being targeted for speaking up to support Palestine?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Organizing protests like last year’s encampments and doing other
forms of direct actions are still options</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Some grad students who are immigrants are afraid to travel
home, travel to other states, or move around on campus because they
are afraid of being abducted (this includes students with legal
status).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q6. Has the UNC AAUP expressed concerns about ICE raids to the administration?</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>No, because UNC AAUP, as a small organization, is not big enough to
meet independently with the administration. This moment is a chance
to join the AAUP and shape the organization the way you want to see
it. The AAUP is us.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We also can build power by connecting with the other AAUPs across
North Carolina and organizing with them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>On how to think about the current moment</strong>:<ul>
<li>We can’t be quiet now because these times are like the height of Jim
Crow segregation in the 1940s and 1950s.</li>
<li>As academics, it’s uncomfortable for some of us to confront this
moment because we are not used to consciously being involved in
political struggles. Acknowledge your discomfort and privilege that
may have shielded you from recognizing the political stakes of higher
education before. What privilege are you willing to give up to
confront the moment?</li>
<li>Acknowledge how the government’s attacks are rooted in white
supremacy and other forms of oppression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On supporting legal defense orgs</strong>: Donate to legal
organizations. Though legal defense can’t be our only strategy, the
progressive legal organizations have rapidly mounted a defense
against political attacks and are stretched thin. Some organizations
to support: <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>, <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/">the Center for
Constitutional Rights</a>, and <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/">Just
Security</a>.</li>
<li><strong>On ICE Raids</strong>:<ul>
<li>We should get training on how to protect people in case of ICE
raids, for instance, developing a trusted, verified warning system if
ICE is on campus. <strong>Call Siembra’s hotline to report suspected ICE
raids 336-543-0353. Confirm with Siembra if the ICE raid is real
before sharing the information</strong> <strong>in your network</strong>.</li>
<li>Get the university to clarify what counts as public and private
space on campus.</li>
<li>Create a network of people to provide refuge from ICE.</li>
<li>Join other local social organizations that have already been doing
this work and learn from their expertise. Follow their lead.</li>
<li>Create a buddy system where people walk people who may be targeted home.</li>
<li>Direct action to interrupt people who ICE is kidnapping: filming,
asking for signed warrant from judge, asking them to identify
themselves.</li>
<li>Lock classroom doors to slow ICE from entering.</li>
<li>Recognize that some immigrant communities have their own networks of
keeping informed about ICE. Yet, not all immigrants are plugged into
those communities, especially international students.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On organizing against funding cuts</strong>:<ul>
<li>Stand up for each other because the government is cutting our
funding regardless of our discipline</li>
<li>The grad workers union hired an independent auditor to study the
financial health of UNC. The auditor found that UNC has plenty of
money to operate and cuts aren’t warranted based on the funding they
had before the federal government’s attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>General ideas for organizing and next steps</strong><ul>
<li>Create a rapid response playbook if something happens on campus. For
instance, staging mass walkouts.</li>
<li>Create regular meetings of task forces based on the various threats
to higher education: ICE and immigration, resegregation and anti-DEI,
attacks on protest especially pro-Palestinian protest, defunding of
higher education, anti-trans attacks</li>
<li>Improve communication and coordination between faculty and student
organizations on campus.</li>
<li>Return to analog technology like phone trees and in-person meetings.</li>
<li>Support different modes of resistance, including direct action.</li>
<li>Join other local organizations that doing this work such as
<a href="https://www.chapelhillcarrboronaacp.com/">NAACP</a> and
<a href="https://surj.org/our-work/chapters/">SURJ</a> (a white anti-racist
organization)</li>
<li>Do community care by checking in on how other people are doing and
connecting with other people as well as self-care.</li>
<li>Create a secure way to communicate with each other.</li>
<li>Finds ways to proactively support students who have been visible in
their support of Palestine against attack by the government.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Be careful about putting vulnerable groups, like
immigrants and/or people of color in danger when trying to help
them. Ask how to best to helpful.</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The AAUP has joined up with the AFT to sue the Trump administration
over the unlawful funding cuts at Columbia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AAUP-AFT-v-DOJ-Complaint.pdf"><em>This action challenges the Trump administration’s unlawful and
unprecedented effort to overpower a university’s academic autonomy and
control the thought, association, scholarship, and expression of its
faculty and
students.</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AAUP has also joined with the Middle East Studies Association,
AAUP-NYU, AAUP Rutgers, and AAUP Harvard in a separate suit that
alleges that the constitutional rights of US citizen faculty are being
violated by the Trump Administration’s immigration policies which
suppress the speech of non-citizen faculty and students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/pwkvocf6z4"><em>Plaintiffs are associations whose members include thousands of
faculty and students at universities across the country.  They
commence this action because the ideological-deportation policy, and
the repressive climate it has engendered, has far-reaching
implications for the expressive and associational rights of their
U.S. citizen members, and for Plaintiffs themselves. The policy
prevents or impedes Plaintiffs’ U.S.  citizen members from hearing
from, and associating with, their noncitizen students and
colleagues.</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Updates on both suits and other actions will be coming from the
national leadership.</p>
