  <p>The UNC-Chapel Hill Chapter of AAUP opposes classroom recording for
any reason without the instructor’s consent. We were shocked to learn
on Monday February 9th that the Interim Provost had drafted a new
policy allowing the recording of classes to go into effect on Monday
February 16th.</p>

  <h3>Academic Freedom Code for UNC System</h3>
<p>Last week the UNC System Board of Governors &quot;<a href="https://www.wunc.org/education/2026-01-28/nc-professors-fear-new-academic-freedom-policy-censor-faculty">unanimously approved the
System&#39;s academic freedom
definition</a>,&quot;
which seeks to set
&quot;<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2026/01/29/unc-plans-define-what-academic-freedom-and-isnt">limits</a>&quot;
on academic freedom, and put it forward for a binding vote at their
next meeting on Feb. 25th. The NC AAUP&#39;s Syllabus Committee (including
members from our chapter) will communicate a statewide strategy in
advance of the BoG mtg.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5uv1atZ6xoUiToNH_UcvswTWsXmB1prhZDZo1fif80/edit?tab=t.0">the proposed revised
policy</a>. Be
sure to note the &quot;system suggestions in red.&quot;</p>
<p>See the <a href="/assets/letter-re-proposed-changes-to-academic-freedom-code-2026-01-26.pdf">letter from AAUP&#39;s
lawyers</a>
to the UNC System about the proposed policy revisions. <strong>Please
circulate this letter widely.</strong></p>

  <p>Today the UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP, UE 150, and TransparUNCy sent <a href="/assets/joint-statement-on-uscbp-at-unc-ch.pdf">a joint statement</a> to Chancellor Roberts, Interim Provost Dean, Dean White, and Dean Rieckenberg demanding that UNC Chapel Hill ensure the safety of its students and staff in the face of domestic terrorism.</p>

  <p>In his November 13 presentation, independent auditor Dr. Howard Bunsis
(Professor of Accounting, Eastern Michigan University) posed the
question to everyone in the audience, “Why is a university with a AAA
bond rating and billions in reserves considering layoffs and cutting
budgets?”  UNC Chapel Hill learned this week that all three
independent bond rating agencies -- Moodys, S&amp;P, and Fitch -- gave it
an outstanding AAA bond rating, placing it in a small minority of
universities at the top rank. Not only that, the University currently
has $1.9 billion in unrestricted reserves, and $1 billion cash on
hand. Bunsis made it clear that one of the things the University is
dedicated to is spending its money on high-level administrators and
their salaries. From 2016-2024, the number of administrators in Chapel
Hill has increased by 51.1%, but the full-time faculty by only 10.8%,
and the staff has been shrunk by 5.3%. Over the same period,
administrators’ salaries in the UNC budget have increased by 106%, but
the instructional budget only by 36.2%, and research budget by
41.7%. Yet the Chapel Hill administration and its Board of Trustees
are seeking to implement a $70 million austerity cut.</p>
<p>Michael Palm, President of the AAUP chapter, UNC Chapel Hill, stated:
“This audit lays bare the truth: any cuts to programs or personnel at
UNC-Chapel Hill are the result of political pressure, not financial
constraints. UNC’s budgeting decisions must be transparent and
inclusive of students, faculty, and staff as well as accountants,
lawyers, and administrators.”</p>

and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ULAvWgrjDc">watch the
presentation</a> revealing
that the university is in stellar financial condition, has a huge
buildup in administrators and their salaries, but seeks to impose a
$70 million cut on its lowest-paid staff.</p>

  <h3>UNC Audit Analysis Presentation</h3>
<h4>Thursday, 11/13 @ 5:30 pm, Kerr Hall 1001</h4>
<p>Please join us in person or virtually to receive the findings from
Howard Bunsis&#39;s independent audit of UNC finances. Bunsis&#39;s analysis
equips us with data to challenge ServiceFirst austerity measures to
reduce faculty and staff numbers, salaries, and benefits.</p>
<p>The presentation begins at 5:30 pm and will be followed by a Q&amp;A. The
main entrance to Kerr will be unlocked until 5:45, though facilitators
will be available to let you in if you&#39;re arriving late.</p>
<p>The event is especially exciting as it represents a collaborative
effort between UE 150 (grad students and staff workers), UNC-AAUP
(us), and TransparUNCy (undergraduates).</p>

<h3>No Compact for Higher Ed at UNC</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wral.com/news/education/unc-chapel-hill-rejects-trump-education-compact-november-2025/">After the rally Friday led by Sunrise UNC and other student groups,
Chancellor Roberts said at the Faculty Council meeting that afternoon
that UNC would not agree to the Trump administration&#39;s Compact for
Higher
Ed.</a>
See <a href="/assets/aaup-vs-compact.pdf">the statement we distributed at the
meeting</a>.</p>
<h3>No new accreditor for UNC (at least for now)</h3>
<p>At the Faculty Council meeting, Provost Dean said UNC-CH would go with
the same accreditor in 2027, rather than <a href="https://www.theassemblync.com/education/unc-cphe-college-accreditation/">switching to
CPHE</a>,
which met with applause. Last week the UNC-Charlotte AAUP chapter
published this powerful <a href="https://www.ninertimes.com/opinion/letter-to-the-editor-prevent-the-floridification-of-north-carolina-accreditation/article_0ea23377-0195-459d-8af3-7571d106cb68.html">letter to the

<p>The Black Student Movement will be hosting a Town Hall on Monday,
October 27th, at 6:00 PM in the Hitchcock Room of the Stone

any questions students, staff, and alumni may have. We are inviting
all Black organizations, faculty, and alumni to join us in this
important conversation. This space was not only taken from BSM as an
organization but from us collectively as a community. So, we&#39;re
looking for your support, presence, and engagement as we work together
to reclaim and restore it.</p>

the Narrative: Higher Ed for the Common
Good</a>,
a two-hour training webinar will equip you with practical tools to
tell your story and amplify the value of higher education in public
life.</p>
<p>Higher education is under coordinated attack, from funding cuts and
DEI bans to assaults on tenure, free speech, and the safety of
international scholars and students. Our individual stories of how our
work in higher education makes a difference are the most powerful
antidote to the misinformation campaign against higher
education. Truth is resistance.  Every story we can share with the
public pushes back against false narratives that paint higher ed as
elitist and broken.</p>
<p>In this training, you&#39;ll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write powerful op-eds and letters to the editor</li>
<li>Use social media to reach wider audiences</li>
<li>Prepare for media interviews with confidence</li>
<li>Adapt these materials to host Reclaim the Narrative workshops on
your own campus</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Congrats to our colleague Dwayne Dixon on returning to the classroom!</h3>
<p>Read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eLrb98o3HLmJCvqymd7aW6bzGBPXyJHtNcxKBSsMyjk/edit?tab=t.0">Professor Dixon’s

and <a href="https://unc-ch-aaup.org/assets/unc-ch-aaup-statement-on-dwayne-dixon.pdf">our statement calling for his
reinstatement</a>.</p>
<h3>AAUP Press Conference @ UNC: Wednesday, Oct. 8, 11am</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, October 8 at 11am, we will gather outside UNC’s South
Building, where AAUP officers along with UNC students will speak to
the press, make some announcements, and then walk to New West with
Professor Dwayne Dixon and his students. They’ll be returning to class
for the first time since September 29, when Professor Dixon was
<a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2025/10/breaking-university-dwayne-dixon-reinstated">wrongfully and harmfully placed on administrative
leave</a>. On
Friday, October 3, the administration <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2025/10/03/unc-professor-dwayne-dixon-reinstated-after-suspension-over-anti-fascist-ties/">finally reinstated
Dixon</a>
after significant pressure from the community, including AAUP NC,
AAUP-Chapel Hill, UNC’s YDSA, UE-150, the ACLU of NC, and many of
Dixon’s admiring colleagues and students.</p>
<p>We’ll be cheering their return but also using this moment to lay out,
for faculty and the public, the many issues caused by UNC-Chapel
Hill’s administration’s egregious attacks on faculty and students’
academic freedom and First Amendment rights—not just last week’s
unnecessary and painful disruption of the fall semester for 300+
students, but also the <a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/aaup-president-calls-explanation-unc-chapel-hill-tenure-delay">harmful tenure vote delay for 33 faculty
members at UNC in
May</a>
and the <a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2025/08/university-hanes-palestinian-art-exhibit-covered-up">illegal removal and destruction of a student-created,
faculty-approved pro-Palestinian mural in
August</a>.</p>
<h3>Meet-up at Namu: Tuesday, Oct. 14, 4:30–6:30pm</h3>
<p>We’re gathering to celebrate our recently promoted and tenured
colleagues—and to raise a glass to our important collective wins:
fighting tenure delays, showing up for students’ freedom of speech,
and organizing to defend academic freedom—we have a lot to celebrate!
Join us at <a href="https://www.namudurham.com/">Namu</a> for conversations and
collegiality, and please invite your UNC colleagues.</p>

<p>The Administration of Free Speech: A TransparUNCy Conversation with
Former Provost Chris Clemens, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2pm, Carroll Hall.</p>
<p>For this year’s First Amendment Day, TransparUNCy will be joined by
former Provost Chris Clemens for a discussion about some of the most
contentious conflicts in higher education and their implications for
free speech. How do debates around DEI, “institutional neutrality,”
student protest, tenure, and the ongoing politicization of university
governance affect the conditions for free speech on our campus?</p>

<h3>CITAP First Amendment Event at UNC, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2:45–3:45pm</h3>
<p>CITAP First Amendment Event at UNC, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2:45–3:45pm, Carroll Hall</p>
<p><a href="https://medialaw.unc.edu/events/citap1a_day_2025/">https://medialaw.unc.edu/events/citap1a_day_2025/</a></p>
<p>In collaboration with the What’s at Stake project
<a href="https://www.onthestakes.com/">https://www.onthestakes.com/</a>, join this timely discussion on the
role of First Amendment freedoms in protecting democracy.</p>
<p>The United States is backsliding into what political scientists call
“electoral autocracy,” where elections are held but there is not free
and fair competition. The President and his party are weaponizing the
state to weaken the political opposition and the journalism outlets,
media, platforms, and universities that can hold them accountable,
including through elections. At such a moment, the First Amendment
freedom to produce information and knowledge in the public interest
that safeguards democratic elections, processes, and norms is
crucial. This panel will provide a clear-eyed, research-based analysis
of what is at stake and argue for the right—and responsibility—of
media and platforms to serve as democratic gatekeepers and hold
elected leaders accountable for eroding checks on their power. At a
time when many university administrators and faculty would rather talk
about the hypothetical threats of AI than the wolves at the door,
panelists will detail the urgency of the existential threats to our
shared democratic life, the violent consequences of inaction such as
during the attempted coup on January 6th, and the ways that
journalism, platforms, and universities must rise to meet the moment
and fulfill their obligation of serving the public interest.</p>

  <p>On the night before the start of Fall 2025 semester, facilities
workers at UNC-Chapel Hill boarded over and subsequently removed a
student- and community-created mural in Hanes Art Center. The mural
was initiated and created by several students in the undergraduate
course Studio Art 490: Art as Social Action, with help from other
students across campus. No Art Department faculty were consulted
before the mural was covered and removed, and no one has taken
responsibility for this censorship.</p>
<p>The American Association of University Professors North Carolina and
the UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP call on Chancellor Lee Roberts
and Interim Provost Jim Dean to restore the mural and publicly explain
how the decision to remove it was made and by whom.</p>
<p>See the full <a href="/assets/unc-ch-aaup-statement-on-mural-censorship.pdf">UNC-CH AAUP statement on mural censorship at
UNC</a>.</p>
<p>AAUP North Carolina and the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of AAUP stand in
solidarity with the professors and students whose academic freedom and
free speech rights were violated by the cover-up, removal, and
destruction of the student-created mural &quot;I told you I loved you (Gaza
Solidarity).&quot;</p>
<p>The campus community is invited to print T-shirts and posters bearing
the quote from poet June Jordan that appears prominently on the mural:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I told you I loved you and I wanted genocide to stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meet outside Hanes Art Center, where the mural was located, at 3pm on
Wednesday, September 3. Bring a blank t-shirt if you&#39;d like to
screenprint.</p>

  <p>In the 2024–2025 academic year, the School of Civic Life and
Leadership (SCiLL) established a record that should cause
embarrassment to UNC’s leaders. Of the nine Chapel Hill faculty
initially brought on board to staff the SCiLL, at least six have
already resigned, citing defective leadership, mission drift, and
shocking procedural irregularities.</p>
<p>The expansion of SCiLL and the legislature’s design to exclude current
UNC-CH faculty from planning and decision-making comes as other
programs <em>actually created by faculty and staffed by scholars with
genuine disciplinary expertise</em> will probably be placed on the
chopping block.</p>

  <p>In a statement released today, national AAUP President Todd Wolfson
congratulated the thirty-three faculty members in the College of Arts
and Sciences and professional schools who finally received a tenure
vote, after having been denied one without announcement or explanation
by the UNC–Chapel Hill Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Wolfson notes that the state of academic freedom and faculty
governance at North Carolina’s flagship school, the first public
university in the United States, is now in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thirteen-member UNC–Chapel Hill Board of Trustees … has
significant work to do to repair the damage to academic freedom and
the reputation of the university. Faculty members and their
departments, who expected a transparent and honest tenure review,
deserve answers to their questions: Why didn’t the board approve
these faculty members in March? Why were humanities, social
sciences, and professional school faculty targeted? What will be
done to ensure this kind of delay does not happen again?</p>

  <p><strong>The UNC-CH chapter of the AAUP strongly and unequivocally condemns the
targeting of international students and scholars.</strong></p>
<p>In light of the April 8 <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article303778476.html">revocation of six UNC student visas</a>, we
call on UNC-CH to take concrete steps to support students and scholars
at risk. At a moment when the future of higher education and free
speech are in peril, our institution has obligations beyond doing no
harm. If we fail to protect international students and scholars, we
jeopardize the safety and academic freedom of all students and
scholars and the integrity of the university as a whole.</p>
<p>We therefore make the following demands of UNC-CH’s leaders:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain enrollment and allow continued study and resource access
for our international students and scholars whose visas have been
unjustly revoked.</li>
<li>Provide and pay for legal counsel for those students and scholars
whose visas have been revoked.</li>
<li>Work swiftly and affirmatively—through lawsuits, if necessary—to
stop further termination-without-due-process of legal statuses of
students and scholars.</li>
<li>Allow international students and scholars to continue their
studies, research, and paid work, including teaching and research
assistantships and fellowships, remotely.</li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/2025.04.07-AAUP-Letter-to-GCs-corrected.pdf">AAUP’s guidelines for general counsels</a> to protect
student information.</li>
<li>Avoid voluntary cooperation or information-sharing with Immigration
and Customs Enforcement, other federal agencies charged with
investigating students’ and scholars’ protected speech, revoking
visas, and/or facilitating deportations.</li>
<li>Provide immediate notification to students and scholars of any
changes in their legal statuses and share reliable information in a
timely fashion with all international students and scholars.</li>

  <p>On Thursday, 3/27/25 the UNC AAUP held a hybrid meeting for concerned
members of the UNC community (AAUP member or not) about the current
attacks on higher education. While there were suggested topics of
conversation, the attendees focused on how to be proactive in
protecting UNC community members from ICE raids.</p>
<h4>Invited guests</h4>
<p>AAUP Vice-President Rotua Lumbantobing and Osamudia James, UNC Law
Professor and co-signer of <a href="https://app.box.com/s/2me4mszr6p4oinnucw8i4jmb8d7570kp">this
memo</a> to
university OGCs explaining the lawfulness of DEI programs. (VP
Lumbantobing was unable to join via zoom.)</p>
<h4>Summary of key next steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Two working groups formed, focused on “Information and Resources”
and “Emergency Support” for students, faculty and staff
at-risk. Email <a href="mailto:mwpalm@gmail.com">mwpalm@gmail.com</a> to join either.</li>
<li>Most immediately, attendees wanted <strong>clarity from the university</strong>
about what counts <strong>as private space</strong> on campus that ICE agents
can’t enter without a warrant. The Faculty Senate has already raised
this issue but hasn’t gotten a clear answer.</li>
<li>Share best practices for keeping UNC community members safe from ICE
and other forces of policing on campus</li>
<li>Create a way to keep in touch with members who attended the
meeting. Email <a href="mailto:info@unc-ch-aaup.org">info@unc-ch-aaup.org</a> if you want to join or organize
a task force or if you want to join the UNC Chapter of the
AAUP. Email Michael Palm, <a href="mailto:mwpalm@gmail.com">mwpalm@gmail.com</a>, if you want to be on the
AAUP listserv. You don’t have to be a member of the AAUP to be on
the listserv.</li>
<li>Join with other local organizations, like
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/transparuncy/">TransparUNCy</a> (undergrad
activist group worth following) and <a href="https://www.workersunionunc.com/">UE Local
150</a>, which are advocating for
similar causes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have to support one another to stay vocal and co-create the
leadership and community we are seeking.</p>
<p>We need to both donate to and show up for local chapters of groups
like NAACP, Men for Racial Justice, and other grassroots community
groups.</p>
<h4>Questions and answers</h4>
<h5>Q1. Why join the AAUP?</h5>
<ul>
<li>AAUP files lawsuits that defend higher education and protect faculty</li>
<li>AAUP protects academic freedom. <a href="https://www.aaup.org/about/history-aaup">The organization was founded in
1915 to define and defend academic freedom, a role it continues to
play</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: State law prohibits North Carolina employees from
collective bargaining, giving state employees fewer rights and
protections than most other states. However, we do have the right to
unionize.</li>
<li>AAUP protects promotion and tenure rights through its <a href="https://www.aaup.org/about/committees">Committee on
Academic Freedom and Tenure (Committee
A)</a> and <a href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure/resources-tenure">the policies it has
affirmed dating back to its founding in
1915</a>.</li>
<li>The AAUP and professional organizations are providing leadership
right now that the university isn’t.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: The dues to join are expensive but 1. You can pay in
monthly installments and 2. The national AAUP gives a lot of money
back to the state AAUP to use locally.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q2. Who, if anyone, is organizing with staff?</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.workersunionunc.com/">UE Local 150</a> is the union for
staff at UNC and graduate student workers. Staff members often
attend meetings that faculty organize. Not sure about grad student
workers.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Staff are particularly vulnerable, especially if their
positions are dependent on grants.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q3. What are other tactics can we use besides filing lawsuits to resist the attack on higher education?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Join the planned <strong>Days of Action</strong> organized by the AAUP<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.killthecuts.org/">April 8</a> Day of Action: Kill the Cuts</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dayofactionforhighered.org/">April 17</a> Day of Action
for Higher Ed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share collectively sourced information about best practices that
been effective in defending our rights</li>
<li>Compile and share information about which federal grants have been
cut at so that we can raise awareness about the harms the cuts have
caused and gauge the extent of the cuts. <strong>To do: Create a local to
UNC list of cancelled grants to supplement what’s already
available. Can be crowdsourced.</strong><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sssp1.org/index.cfm/pageid/2626?fbclid=IwY2xjawJT2wVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHbeQkXOi4Ae0KYqtdAzJeNzaDRTlwreejsYpmxD38LB9STxzArzV5Dvvmw_aem_LSTQjpZeSgDfFW8oOFnyeA">Here are guidelines about what to do if your federal grant is
ended</a></li>
<li><a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf">Here is a report from Department of Health and Human Services and
the NIH listing grants that have been terminated as of
3/21/25</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q4. What can do to protect people targeted by ICE, especially immigrants and other people with precarious citizenship status? Relatedly, how do we protect rights of protestors?</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mesana.org/resources-and-opportunities/2025/03/21/trumps-immigration-actions-what-to-know-webinar">AAUP and the Middle East Studies Association (MESA) had a know
 your rights webinar on
 3-27-25</a></li>
<li>When talking to UNC administration or with ICE agents, emphasize
your Fourth Amendment Right to be protected from unreasonable search
and seizure. Stand up for other people if you see them being
attacked by ICE.</li>
<li>Get trained by Siembra NC about how to protect people from ICE
raids. Go to a training, join or volunteer at Siembra, and <a href="https://defendandrecruit.org/">download
this playbook</a> from them about what
to do defend immigrants. Also helpful: <a href="https://righttobe.org/events/bystander-intervention-to-support-the-immigrant-community-3/">Upstander
Training.</a></li>
<li>Federal law says that ICE can’t enter <strong>private spaces</strong> without a
judicial warrant signed by a judge. So far, UNC has established that
dorms are private spaces that ICE can’t enter without a warrant if
the entry is locked. <strong>To do</strong>: Get UNC to define what other spaces
on campus count as private spaces. For instance, offices seem like
they should be considered private spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q5. What is the AAUP and other members of campus doing to protect grad students of color who are being targeted for speaking up to support Palestine?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Organizing protests like last year’s encampments and doing other
forms of direct actions are still options</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Some grad students who are immigrants are afraid to travel
home, travel to other states, or move around on campus because they
are afraid of being abducted (this includes students with legal
status).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Q6. Has the UNC AAUP expressed concerns about ICE raids to the administration?</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>No, because UNC AAUP, as a small organization, is not big enough to
meet independently with the administration. This moment is a chance
to join the AAUP and shape the organization the way you want to see
it. The AAUP is us.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We also can build power by connecting with the other AAUPs across
North Carolina and organizing with them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>On how to think about the current moment</strong>:<ul>
<li>We can’t be quiet now because these times are like the height of Jim
Crow segregation in the 1940s and 1950s.</li>
<li>As academics, it’s uncomfortable for some of us to confront this
moment because we are not used to consciously being involved in
political struggles. Acknowledge your discomfort and privilege that
may have shielded you from recognizing the political stakes of higher
education before. What privilege are you willing to give up to
confront the moment?</li>
<li>Acknowledge how the government’s attacks are rooted in white
supremacy and other forms of oppression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On supporting legal defense orgs</strong>: Donate to legal
organizations. Though legal defense can’t be our only strategy, the
progressive legal organizations have rapidly mounted a defense
against political attacks and are stretched thin. Some organizations
to support: <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>, <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/">the Center for
Constitutional Rights</a>, and <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/">Just
Security</a>.</li>
<li><strong>On ICE Raids</strong>:<ul>
<li>We should get training on how to protect people in case of ICE
raids, for instance, developing a trusted, verified warning system if
ICE is on campus. <strong>Call Siembra’s hotline to report suspected ICE
raids 336-543-0353. Confirm with Siembra if the ICE raid is real
before sharing the information</strong> <strong>in your network</strong>.</li>
<li>Get the university to clarify what counts as public and private
space on campus.</li>
<li>Create a network of people to provide refuge from ICE.</li>
<li>Join other local social organizations that have already been doing
this work and learn from their expertise. Follow their lead.</li>
<li>Create a buddy system where people walk people who may be targeted home.</li>
<li>Direct action to interrupt people who ICE is kidnapping: filming,
asking for signed warrant from judge, asking them to identify
themselves.</li>
<li>Lock classroom doors to slow ICE from entering.</li>
<li>Recognize that some immigrant communities have their own networks of
keeping informed about ICE. Yet, not all immigrants are plugged into
those communities, especially international students.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On organizing against funding cuts</strong>:<ul>
<li>Stand up for each other because the government is cutting our
funding regardless of our discipline</li>
<li>The grad workers union hired an independent auditor to study the
financial health of UNC. The auditor found that UNC has plenty of
money to operate and cuts aren’t warranted based on the funding they
had before the federal government’s attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>General ideas for organizing and next steps</strong><ul>
<li>Create a rapid response playbook if something happens on campus. For
instance, staging mass walkouts.</li>
<li>Create regular meetings of task forces based on the various threats
to higher education: ICE and immigration, resegregation and anti-DEI,
attacks on protest especially pro-Palestinian protest, defunding of
higher education, anti-trans attacks</li>
<li>Improve communication and coordination between faculty and student
organizations on campus.</li>
<li>Return to analog technology like phone trees and in-person meetings.</li>
<li>Support different modes of resistance, including direct action.</li>
<li>Join other local organizations that doing this work such as
<a href="https://www.chapelhillcarrboronaacp.com/">NAACP</a> and
<a href="https://surj.org/our-work/chapters/">SURJ</a> (a white anti-racist
organization)</li>
<li>Do community care by checking in on how other people are doing and
connecting with other people as well as self-care.</li>
<li>Create a secure way to communicate with each other.</li>
<li>Finds ways to proactively support students who have been visible in
their support of Palestine against attack by the government.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Be careful about putting vulnerable groups, like
immigrants and/or people of color in danger when trying to help
them. Ask how to best to helpful.</li>

  <p>The AAUP has joined up with the AFT to sue the Trump administration
over the unlawful funding cuts at Columbia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AAUP-AFT-v-DOJ-Complaint.pdf"><em>This action challenges the Trump administration’s unlawful and
unprecedented effort to overpower a university’s academic autonomy and
control the thought, association, scholarship, and expression of its
faculty and
students.</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AAUP has also joined with the Middle East Studies Association,
AAUP-NYU, AAUP Rutgers, and AAUP Harvard in a separate suit that
alleges that the constitutional rights of US citizen faculty are being
violated by the Trump Administration’s immigration policies which
suppress the speech of non-citizen faculty and students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/pwkvocf6z4"><em>Plaintiffs are associations whose members include thousands of
faculty and students at universities across the country.  They
commence this action because the ideological-deportation policy, and
the repressive climate it has engendered, has far-reaching
implications for the expressive and associational rights of their
U.S. citizen members, and for Plaintiffs themselves. The policy
prevents or impedes Plaintiffs’ U.S.  citizen members from hearing
from, and associating with, their noncitizen students and
colleagues.</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Updates on both suits and other actions will be coming from the
national leadership.</p>

  <p>The national AAUP has a statement for AAUP members regarding the ICE
detention of Mahmoud Kahlil and information about immigrants’ rights
on campus:</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear AAUP Members,</p>
<p>We are alarmed by the <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/breaking-dhs-detains-palestinian">ICE
detention</a> of
former Columbia University graduate student and legal permanent
resident Mahmoud Khalil for what appears to be First
Amendment-protected speech. And we forcefully condemn Secretary of
State Marco Rubio’s <a href="https://x.com/marcorubio/status/1898858967532441945">statement on
X</a> that the
federal government will be revoking the visas and green cards of
immigrants based on their constitutionally protected speech and
association.</p>
<p>This open threat combined with Mr. Khalil’s detention has stoked a
great deal of understandable fear among our noncitizen members. Green
card revocation is rare absent a criminal conviction, and we believe
these actions and threats to be unprecedented and illegal. Indeed,
late Monday, a federal judge <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university-israel-hnk/">temporarily
blocked</a>
Mr. Khalil’s deportation.</p>
<p>Over the past six weeks, we have been working with you and your AAUP
chapter leaders to proactively prepare for these events. Here are the
resources you can find on our <a href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/political-attacks-higher-education">Political Attacks on Higher
Education</a>
web page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/ICE-Flyer.pdf">Recommendations to AAUP chapter leaders and members for dealing with
ICE on your campus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/2025/aftmembersonvisas.pdf">Rights and risks for workers who are in the United States on visas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Issue-Brief-Immigration-Related-Campus-Concerns-2025.pdf">Issue brief on immigration-related campus concerns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aflcio.org/about/programs/adelante-we-rise/immigration-resources/know-your-rights-materials-immigrant-workers">Know Your Rights flyers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/family_preparedness_plan.pdf">Family preparedness plan template</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As these events continue to unfold, we recommend that noncitizen
faculty, students, and staff who believe that they may be similarly
targeted by the federal government take the following precautionary
measures:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Contact an immigration attorney who has experience with deportation
defense. For recommendations, you may consider contacting your local
chapter or affiliate of the <a href="https://www.nlg.org/chapters/">National Lawyers
Guild</a>, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/affiliates">American Civil Liberties
Union</a>, or <a href="https://www.cair.com/about_cair/cair-chapters/">Council on
American-Islamic
Relations</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Review <a href="https://immigrantjustice.org/know-your-rights/ice-encounter">your
rights</a>. You
are under no legal obligation to open the door to immigration
authorities absent a JUDICIAL WARRANT (that is, a warrant signed by a
judge). Please familiarize yourself with the difference between a
judicial warrant and an administrative warrant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we call on higher education stakeholders with US citizenship
to close ranks around, and demand that college and university
administrators and governing boards affirmatively protect, our
noncitizen colleagues and students.</p>
<p>We will be in touch with more information in the coming days and
weeks.</p>
<p>In solidarity,</p>
<p>Veena Dubal, General Counsel, AAUP</p>

  <h3>2025 Meeting of the North Carolina Conference of the AAUP</h3>
<h4>Winning the Fight for Higher Education in NC</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Saturday, April 5, 2025, 9:30AM-4:00PM</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://map.concept3d.com/?id=111#!m/329333">Carolina Union</a> Room 3409</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://forms.gle/PDAhMTU6fu7TqhZX8">RSVP</a> by Friday, March 28</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Right now UNC system schools face an ongoing crisis exacerbated by the
UNC BOG policy on DEI course requirements, as seen in the <a href="https://academeblog.org/2025/02/12/statement-of-the-north-carolina-conference-of-the-aaup-on-unc-system-curricular-interference/">NC AAUP
state conference&#39;s statement of February 11</a>. We also saw just last
summer a new curricular requirement imposed on all UNC students by
politically appointed Board members. The NIH research overhead funding
crisis, meanwhile, threatens to destroy the financial basis of higher
education, paving the way for widespread job losses (of faculty,
staff, grad workers, and positions well beyond the gates of the
universities), increased workloads and new constraints for those who
do manage to keep their jobs, and greatly diminished education at
increased prices for students who are financially able to continue
their studies. As administrators at public and private institutions
fold their arms and look away, nobody is safe from these deadly
attacks. Our only option is to face them and push back together.</p>
<p>On Saturday, April 5, 2025, the annual meeting of the North Carolina
Conference of the AAUP will convene to focus on ways that faculty,
graduate workers, and allies can build common ground. We must defend
our security and that of our students and communities while also
raising awareness of universities and higher education as an essential
public good. We will hear from and work with organizers and advocates
from across the state, and together plan activities for the April 17
National Day of Action for Higher Education and beyond.</p>
<p>Lunch and a light breakfast will be catered. <strong>The NC AAUP can provide
a limited number of hotel rooms for people attending from beyond the
Triangle/Triad. Please ask us about this.</strong></p>

  <p>The national American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is
currently conducting two surveys to understand the impact of recent
executive orders on AAUP members, in order to see who is affected and
may have standing for a lawsuit. These surveys are confidential, but
not anonymous.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first survey aims to understand <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfq1NPvMZCfw89K7Bd9nkUFUFgB-Mei1yR7jYFgz76PIUGzA/viewform">the impact of funding cuts made

<li>The second survey aims to understand <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHVEElq5fVSXPqvWZ827plJZaQtcleCYu2Sc67Mf9papxLmA/viewform">the impact of two executive
orders claiming to combat terrorism and anti-Semitism.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The AAUP is also looking for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Examples of grant funding that have been paused or terminated due
to executive orders issued since January 20, 2025.</li>
<li>Examples of changes to programs, teaching, research, titles,

  <p>The UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP condemns the secret recording
of any instructors for any purpose. This practice violates ethical
standards and the law. The “prevailing academic practice,” according
to the national AAUP’s surveying of colleges and Universities across
the United States, deems <a href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/covid-19-pandemic/pandemic-resources-faqs-remote-teaching-and-copyright">faculty as the copyright owners of their
teaching content</a>. As such, recording the teaching of any content by
any instructors for any purpose without their consent violates that
principle and copyright law. Furthermore, UNC’s own policy states: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240607173338/https://keepteaching.unc.edu/best-practices-for-recording-classes-at-unc-chapel-hill/">“A
classroom recording should not be used for any purpose except to meet
the educational objectives of that particular class.”</a> (See also

  <p>Over 600 UNC-Chapel Hill faculty have signed a letter (<a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/04/opinion-letter-to-editor-aaup-campus-politics-intervention">original</a>, <a href="/assets/unc-faculty-oppose-legislative-overreach.pdf">archived copy</a>) condemning the interference and overreach of the North Carolina legislature, the UNC System Board of Governors, and the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees whose actions violate the principles of academic freedom and shared governance that undergird higher education in N.C. and the U.S. If enacted, we believe that these measures will further damage the reputation of UNC and the state of North Carolina and will likely bring critical scrutiny from accrediting agencies that know undue interference in university affairs when they see it.</p>

  <p>The UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the American Association of University Professors calls upon Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz and Provost Chris Clemens to publicly support and defend UNC students, faculty, and staff who are supportive of Palestinian rights or critical of Israeli policies and practices. In this particular case, in this political climate, blanket statements about the first amendment, such as the one circulated at the beginning of the semester, are not enough.</p>

  <p>The American Association of University Professors has released <a href="/assets/governance-academic-freedom-and-institutional-racism-in-the-unc-system.pdf">a report of the Special Committee on Governance, Academic Freedom, and Institutional Racism in the University of North Carolina system</a>. The report considers the influence of the North Carolina state legislature on the systemwide board of governors and campus boards of trustees. It discusses how political pressure and top-down leadership have obstructed meaningful faculty participation in the UNC system, jeopardized academic freedom, and reinforced institutional racism.</p>
<p>The special committee focused in-depth on UNC‒Chapel Hill as the flagship campus, but also examined events across the entire system. Through interviews with more than fifty individuals across the UNC system, the report details the pattern of political interference from the legislature and unilateral decision-making from university leadership that has increasingly come to affect the entire UNC system, with clear violations of AAUP-supported principles of academic governance set forth in the 1966 <a href="https://www.aaup.org/report/statement-government-colleges-and-universities">Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://fb.watch/cHxSiRWmtu/">recording of the press conference</a> at UNC Chapel Hill announcing the release of the report.</p>
<p>The report has received local and national press coverage:</p>

  <p><a id="israel-palestine-course"></a>The UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) supports the academic freedom of Kylie Broderick and of all instructors at the University of North Carolina. We condemn the recent efforts of Israeli officials and North Carolina politicians to interfere with the teaching practices of UNC-Chapel Hill instructors. We call on administrators at UNC-Chapel Hill and the UNC System to vigorously defend all UNC instructors from such interference. <a href="/assets/unc-ch-aaup-statement-on-israel-palestine-course.pdf">See the entire UNC-Chapel Hill AAUP statement on academic freedom, free speech, and the course “Conflict over Israel/Palestine.”</a></p>
<p><a id="library-cuts"></a>In other news, outgoing UNC-Chapel Hill Provost Robert Blouin has announced that the funding of the UNC Library will be cut by $2 million in the current academic year and by $3 million the following year. The UNC-Chapel Hill AAUP chapter strenuously objects to such cuts at an R-1 research university of UNC-Chapel Hill’s stature, which these cuts would put at risk. We call on the UNC Board of Governors (BOG) to rescind the austerity cuts inflicted on Chapel Hill by the BOG’s own business model. We further call on our campus administration to exhaust every remedy before proceeding to cut our Library holdings, jeopardizing the achievements of UNC faculty, researchers, librarians, and students, and undermining the national reputation of UNC-Chapel Hill.  <a href="/assets/unc-ch-aaup-statement-on-library-cuts.pdf">See the entire UNC-Chapel Hill AAUP statement against cuts to library funding.</a></p>
<p><a id="structural-racism-and-shared-governance"></a>Finally, the national AAUP has launched a special committee to investigate a pattern of egregious violations of principles of academic governance and persistent structural racism in the University of North Carolina System. Among several issues the report will discuss is the widely publicized mishandling of the tenure case of New York Times writer Nikole Hannah-Jones, the influence of the gerrymandered state legislature on the systemwide board of governors and campus boards of trustees, and how the use of political pressure has obstructed meaningful faculty participation in the UNC system. <a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/special-committee-report-structural-racism-and-violations-shared-governance-unc">See the AAUP announcement of its special committee to report on structural racism and violations of shared governance at UNC.</a></p>

  <p>On May 20, the  University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) posted a <a href="/assets/unc-nikole-hannah-jones-tenure-june-21.pdf">statement condemning the UNC-CH Board of Trustees (BOT) for failing to award tenure to Nikole Hannah-Jones</a> (statement updated June 21, 2021 to clarify that the the BOT did not reject Hannah-Jones’s tenure recommendation but failed to act on it).</p>
<p>Now the national leadership of the AAUP has posted a <a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/statement-unc-board-and-nikole-hannah-jones">statement on the UNC Board and Nikole Hannah-Jones</a>, calling on the Board “to immediately reverse its mistaken move to withhold tenure and accept the faculty&#39;s recommendation that Nikole Hannah-Jones be appointed to the Knight chair with tenure.”</p>
<p>UNC-CH AAUP chapter member Hassan Melehy has written a commentary for the Academe Blog on <a href="https://academeblog.org/2021/06/03/the-right-wing-renewal-of-higher-education-in-north-carolina/">“The Right-Wing ‘Renewal’ of Higher Education in North Carolina</a> pointing out that the Board’s failure is just the latest example of the influence over the UNC System Board of Governors and the UNC–CH BOT exercised by conservative activist groups like the Raleigh-based James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal.</p>
<p>At Slate, UNC-CH professor Alice Marwick and UNC-CH professor and UNC-CH AAUP chapter member Daniel Kreiss have written an article on <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/06/nikole-hannah-jones-unc-1619-project-disinformation-campaign.html"> “The Conservative Disinformation Campaign Against Nikole Hannah-Jones”</a> that puts the situation at UNC-CH in the broader context of “a long-term conservative battle against public higher education and the teaching of American racial history.”</p>

  <p>The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees (BOT), <a href="http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2021/05/19/pw-special-report-after-conservative-criticism-unc-backs-down-from-offering-acclaimed-journalist-a-tenured-position/">apparently bowing to pressure from the UNC System’s Board of Governors (BOG)</a>, has <s>rejected</s> <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article251527603.html">failed to act on a tenure recommendation</a> that had the full support of UNC-Chapel Hill Hussman School of Journalism and Media’s <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article250945664.html">faculty and Dean and of UNC-CH’s Chancellor</a>. By blocking Nikole Hannah-Jones’s appointment with tenure, the BOT and BOG have once again engaged in administrative overreach at UNC-Chapel Hill and violated the rules of faculty governance and academic freedom.</p>
<p>The Chapel Hill chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) objects in the strongest possible terms to this latest egregious attack on the core principles of <a href="https://www.aaup.org/our-work/protecting-academic-freedom">academic freedom</a> and <a href="https://www.aaup.org/our-programs/shared-governance">shared governance</a>. We join <a href="https://hussmanfaculty.medium.com/stunned-unc-hussman-schfaculty-statement-on-nikole-hannah-jones-6333c5f5d072">the Hussman School faculty</a> in demanding that the BOT immediately <s>reinstate</s> approve Hannah-Jones’s <s>original</s> appointment with tenure.</p>
<p>All UNC system and campus administrators must respect the faculty&#39;s central role in hiring and tenuring our colleagues and defining educational programming.</p>

  <p>The UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is opposed to the current policy of allowing the UNC System President to name a finalist candidate for chancellor searches at UNC campuses.</p>
<p>The Board of Governors’ recent <a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2021/03/university-fsu-chancellor-controversy">appointment of Darrell Allison as Chancellor at Fayetteville State University</a>—after a normal search had created an initial list of finalists that did not include him—demonstrates that the current system is in violation of the AAUP’s principles of shared campus governance.</p>

  <p>The AAUP national office has sent a <a href="/assets/aaup-letter-to-chair-augustine-3-9-21.pdf">letter of concern</a> to the chair of the Board of Trustees at Fayetteville State University regarding <a href="https://www.faystatefaculty.com/post/chancellor-selection-news-commentary-round-up">their recent selection of Mr. Darrell Allison as chancellor</a>. The faculty senate at Fayetteville State has passed a resolution urging the board to rescind the offer on the grounds that Mr. Allison “lacks the requisite academic experience necessary to serve as the leader of an academic institution.” See also this <a href="http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2021/02/24/pw-special-report-how-did-darrell-allison-cut-in-line-to-become-the-new-chancellor-at-fayetteville-state-its-a-secret/">special report at NC Policy Watch</a>. It appears that the UNC System is once again subordinating the principles of shared governance.</p>
<p>The state AAUP meeting will be held this <strong>Saturday, March 13, from 1 to 3PM</strong> via Zoom.</p>
<p>The meeting’s agenda will be to discuss how shared governance and academic freedom have fared at different North Carolina institutions during COVID. The plan is to have members of each institution represented in the state conference briefly address the following questions, which relate to issues of institutional governance during the pandemic:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How would you characterize the decision to change course delivery methods in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How would you characterize decisions to reopen the campus during the COVID-19 pandemic?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How would you characterize budget decisions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?</p>
</li>
<li><p>In general, how influential has faculty participation been during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to what degree has faculty participation changed since the COVID-19 pandemic?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, have academic programs, majors, or minors been eliminated, or have no programs been eliminated?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, has the administration or board declared a financial exigency or fiscal emergency, or has there been no such declaration? Have there been terminations of faculty appointments, including faculty layoffs, or have there been no such terminations?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, has the administration or board unilaterally declared existing institutional regulations, such as sections of the faculty handbook, as no longer in force?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have faculty at your institution faced any academic freedom issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are other current concerns faculty have at your institution?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are interested in attending, please contact Michael Behrent at <a href="mailto:michaelcbehrent@gmail.com">michaelcbehrent@gmail.com</a> to request the Zoom link. It will be made available to any AAUP member or faculty member who requests it.</p>

  <p>The serial dishonesty displayed by the UNC-Chapel Hill chancellor and his associates regarding the most sensitive and important matters confronting the University in recent years has eroded our confidence in UNC&#39;s leadership. The members of the UNC-Chapel Hill Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) urge Chancellor Guskiewicz, and others who have contributed to UNC’s pattern of institutional dishonesty, to step down.</p>

  <p>As many of our departments are scheduling next semester&#39;s courses, and
crucial decisions for Spring are being made, the UNC-CH chapter of the
AAUP invites all UNC students, employees, and community members to an
open meeting on <strong>Friday, Oct. 30th from Noon - 1:30pm EDT</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://unc.zoom.us/j/96570533947?pwd=WTFSOUxZUTgzNjE1emxHOC9DZklKQT09">https://unc.zoom.us/j/96570533947?pwd=WTFSOUxZUTgzNjE1emxHOC9DZklKQT09</a></p>
<p>UNC&#39;s plan to reopen campuses for the start of the Fall semester was
fundamentally flawed and doomed to fail. Across the U.S., young adults
ages 18 to 22 saw a 55% increase nationally in Covid-19 cases in
August. And now, in North Carolina, hospitalization rates are the
highest since July. This meeting will provide a space to share
concerns and experiences and to exchange ideas, and we will hear brief
reports from the working groups (Strategy, Finance, Governance) that
emerged from our open meetings this summer.</p>
<p>This fall the groups have developed a detailed analysis of UNC&#39;s
budgets and governance, titled “Another UNC is Possible.” A summary
statement will be discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>UNC’s financial crisis did not begin with Covid-19, and now that we&#39;re
facing economic losses as a result of the pandemic, new approaches—to
the Spring semester and beyond—are needed.</p>
<p>Please distribute widely. All UNC students, employees, and community
neighbors are welcome.</p>

  <p>As of August 17, 279 students and 45 employees at UNC-CH had tested positive, according to UNC-CH Campus Health (a rate of over 12%). Many of us were, therefore, relieved by yesterday&#39;s announcement that all undergraduate instruction at UNC-Chapel Hill would move on-line starting today, August 19.</p>
<p>But we are not out of the woods yet. Our leaders are making no move to send students home and have no plans to close the dorms. There will be no effort to reduce density at fraternities and sororities, over which the university has limited jurisdiction. In short, the threat of continued viral spread will remain high. Campus workers, the entire communities of Chapel Hill and Carrboro, as well as many students are still vulnerable.</p>
<p>The situation at other UNC campuses, forced by the BOG to stay open, is likely to get just as bad or worse. Clusters have already appeared at ECU, Appalachian State, NC State, and UNC-Wilmington.</p>
<p>In light of these conditions, we are asking you once again to join us in a call on our leaders to intervene. We have prepared a letter to Governor Cooper and other state leaders asking them to order all system campuses to close their dorms to all but the students who must stay on campus and to move instruction on-line. Simply fill out the form at the link below.</p>
<p>Click here to <a href="http://bit.ly/dysfUNCtional">read and send a letter</a> urging Governor Cooper and state and county health directors to close campus residences to most students and move all system instruction online.</p>
<p>We are also calling another meeting of faculty, staff, and students from UNC-CH and from other UNC campuses to discuss the situation and our next steps.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday, February 27 the Duke Human Rights Center is holding an event that should interest AAUP members: <a href="https://humanrights.fhi.duke.edu/event-detail/the-koch-network-and-academic-integrity-is-there-a-conflict/">The Koch network and academic integrity: Is there a conflict?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The network of arch-right billionaire and multi-millionaire donors built by Charles and David Koch is funding a vast apparatus of organizations to radically change public policy and the law on matters from health care and environmental protection to labor and tax policies and reproductive rights and voting, even to alter the U.S. Constitution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Charles Koch Foundation is now funding centers on campuses, too—including at Duke and UNC Chapel Hill. Will this presence just expand dialogue or does it represent something more disturbing?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This panel of faculty and community leaders will explore the impact on our state of the Koch political operations (and those of those of their longtime North Carolina ally, Art Pope) to address vital questions for the future of our universities, our state, and our country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speakers will include <a href="https://history.duke.edu/people/william-h-chafe">William Chafe</a> (Alice Mary Baldwin Professor Emeritus of History and Public Policy at Duke), Tomas Lopez (Executive Director of <a href="https://democracync.org">Democracy North Carolina</a>), Kate Torrey (Board Chair of <a href="https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-votes-south-atlantic">Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic</a>), <a href="https://www.facingsouth.org/author/rebekah-barber">Rebekah Barber</a> (researcher and writer at the Institute for Southern Studies), and <a href="http://rpe.religion.wfu.edu/faculty/dr-steve-boyd/">Steve Boyd</a> (Easley Professor of Religion at Wake Forest University).</p>

  <p>Today the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP sent the following statement to interim President Roper, the Board of Trustees, and the Board of Governors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1920, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has advocated for “meaningful faculty participation in institutional governance,” including all important “personnel decisions” and the “selection of administrators” (<a href="https://www.aaup.org/our-programs/shared-governance">https://www.aaup.org/our-programs/shared-governance</a>). The UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP urges interim President Roper, the Board of Governors and our Board of Trustees to return to the AAUP core principle of shared governance at our campus. Specifically, we insist that faculty should be at the table in the selection process for both the interim chancellor and the new permanent chancellor. This would enable faculty to move forward with confidence in our leadership and in the continued viability of shared governance between the faculty, administrators and Boards. Vital governance structures are in a state of disrepair at Chapel Hill and throughout the UNC system; including faculty in the selection of UNC Chapel Hill&#39;s next chancellor would be an important first step in carrying out the repair work that needs to be done. We understand that this matter is time-sensitive, but nothing should preclude the immediate inclusion of faculty in the making of this crucial decision.</p>
