title: UNC-CH AAUP statement on mural censorship at UNC
---

On the night before the start of Fall 2025 semester, facilities
workers at UNC-Chapel Hill boarded over and subsequently removed a
student- and community-created mural in Hanes Art Center. The mural
was initiated and created by several students in the undergraduate
course Studio Art 490: Art as Social Action, with help from other
students across campus. No Art Department faculty were consulted
before the mural was covered and removed, and no one has taken
responsibility for this censorship.

The American Association of University Professors North Carolina and
the UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP call on Chancellor Lee Roberts
and Interim Provost Jim Dean to restore the mural and publicly explain
how the decision to remove it was made and by whom.

See the full [UNC-CH AAUP statement on mural censorship at
UNC](/assets/unc-ch-aaup-statement-on-mural-censorship.pdf).

AAUP North Carolina and the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of AAUP stand in
solidarity with the professors and students whose academic freedom and
free speech rights were violated by the cover-up, removal, and
destruction of the student-created mural "I told you I loved you (Gaza
Solidarity)."

The campus community is invited to print T-shirts and posters bearing
the quote from poet June Jordan that appears prominently on the mural:

> I told you I loved you and I wanted genocide to stop.

Meet outside Hanes Art Center, where the mural was located, at 3pm on
Wednesday, September 3. Bring a blank t-shirt if you'd like to
screenprint.
