title: UNC-CH AAUP statement on the revoking of Nikole Hannah-Jones’s appointment with tenure
---

The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill’s Board of Trustees (BOT), [apparently bowing to pressure from the UNC System’s Board of Governors (BOG)](http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2021/05/19/pw-special-report-after-conservative-criticism-unc-backs-down-from-offering-acclaimed-journalist-a-tenured-position/), has [rejected a tenure recommendation](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article251527603.html) that had the full support of UNC-Chapel Hill Hussman School of Journalism and Media’s [faculty and Dean and of UNC-CH’s Chancellor](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article250945664.html). By blocking Nikole Hannah-Jones’s appointment with tenure, the BOT and BOG have once again engaged in administrative overreach at UNC-Chapel Hill and violated the rules of faculty governance and academic freedom.

The Chapel Hill chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) objects in the strongest possible terms to this latest egregious attack on the core principles of [academic freedom](https://www.aaup.org/our-work/protecting-academic-freedom) and [shared governance](https://www.aaup.org/our-programs/shared-governance). We join [the Hussman School faculty](https://hussmanfaculty.medium.com/stunned-unc-hussman-schfaculty-statement-on-nikole-hannah-jones-6333c5f5d072) in demanding that the BOT immediately reinstate Hannah-Jones’s original appointment with tenure.

All UNC system and campus administrators must respect the faculty's central role in hiring and tenuring our colleagues and defining educational programming.
