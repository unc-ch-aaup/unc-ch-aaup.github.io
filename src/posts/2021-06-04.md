title: Statement by AAUP national leadership and commentaries by chapter members on Nikole Hannah-Jones’s appointment
---

On May 20, the  University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) posted a [statement condemning the UNC-CH Board of Trustees (BOT) for failing to award tenure to Nikole Hannah-Jones](/assets/unc-nikole-hannah-jones-tenure-june-21.pdf) (statement updated June 21, 2021 to clarify that the the BOT did not reject Hannah-Jones’s tenure recommendation but failed to act on it).

Now the national leadership of the AAUP has posted a [statement on the UNC Board and Nikole Hannah-Jones](https://www.aaup.org/news/statement-unc-board-and-nikole-hannah-jones), calling on the Board “to immediately reverse its mistaken move to withhold tenure and accept the faculty's recommendation that Nikole Hannah-Jones be appointed to the Knight chair with tenure.”

UNC-CH AAUP chapter member Hassan Melehy has written a commentary for the Academe Blog on [“The Right-Wing ‘Renewal’ of Higher Education in North Carolina](https://academeblog.org/2021/06/03/the-right-wing-renewal-of-higher-education-in-north-carolina/) pointing out that the Board’s failure is just the latest example of the influence over the UNC System Board of Governors and the UNC–CH BOT exercised by conservative activist groups like the Raleigh-based James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal.

At Slate, UNC-CH professor Alice Marwick and UNC-CH professor and UNC-CH AAUP chapter member Daniel Kreiss have written an article on [ “The Conservative Disinformation Campaign Against Nikole Hannah-Jones”](https://slate.com/technology/2021/06/nikole-hannah-jones-unc-1619-project-disinformation-campaign.html) that puts the situation at UNC-CH in the broader context of “a long-term conservative battle against public higher education and the teaching of American racial history.”
