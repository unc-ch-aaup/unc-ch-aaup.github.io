title: What is in UNC Chapel Hill’s Wallet?
---

In his November 13 presentation, independent auditor Dr. Howard Bunsis
(Professor of Accounting, Eastern Michigan University) posed the
question to everyone in the audience, “Why is a university with a AAA
bond rating and billions in reserves considering layoffs and cutting
budgets?”  UNC Chapel Hill learned this week that all three
independent bond rating agencies -- Moodys, S&P, and Fitch -- gave it
an outstanding AAA bond rating, placing it in a small minority of
universities at the top rank. Not only that, the University currently
has $1.9 billion in unrestricted reserves, and $1 billion cash on
hand. Bunsis made it clear that one of the things the University is
dedicated to is spending its money on high-level administrators and
their salaries. From 2016-2024, the number of administrators in Chapel
Hill has increased by 51.1%, but the full-time faculty by only 10.8%,
and the staff has been shrunk by 5.3%. Over the same period,
administrators’ salaries in the UNC budget have increased by 106%, but
the instructional budget only by 36.2%, and research budget by
41.7%. Yet the Chapel Hill administration and its Board of Trustees
are seeking to implement a $70 million austerity cut.

Michael Palm, President of the AAUP chapter, UNC Chapel Hill, stated:
“This audit lays bare the truth: any cuts to programs or personnel at
UNC-Chapel Hill are the result of political pressure, not financial
constraints. UNC’s budgeting decisions must be transparent and
inclusive of students, faculty, and staff as well as accountants,
lawyers, and administrators.”

that the university is in stellar financial condition, has a huge
buildup in administrators and their salaries, but seeks to impose a
$70 million cut on its lowest-paid staff.
