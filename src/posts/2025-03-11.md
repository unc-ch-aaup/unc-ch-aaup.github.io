The national AAUP has a statement for AAUP members regarding the ICE
detention of Mahmoud Kahlil and information about immigrants’ rights
on campus:

----

Dear AAUP Members,

We are alarmed by the [ICE
detention](https://zeteo.com/p/breaking-dhs-detains-palestinian) of
former Columbia University graduate student and legal permanent
resident Mahmoud Khalil for what appears to be First
Amendment-protected speech. And we forcefully condemn Secretary of
State Marco Rubio’s [statement on
X](https://x.com/marcorubio/status/1898858967532441945) that the
federal government will be revoking the visas and green cards of
immigrants based on their constitutionally protected speech and
association.

This open threat combined with Mr. Khalil’s detention has stoked a
great deal of understandable fear among our noncitizen members. Green
card revocation is rare absent a criminal conviction, and we believe
these actions and threats to be unprecedented and illegal. Indeed,
late Monday, a federal judge [temporarily
blocked](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university-israel-hnk/)
Mr. Khalil’s deportation.

Over the past six weeks, we have been working with you and your AAUP
chapter leaders to proactively prepare for these events. Here are the
resources you can find on our [Political Attacks on Higher
Education](https://www.aaup.org/issues/political-attacks-higher-education)
web page:

* [Family preparedness plan template](https://www.ilrc.org/sites/default/files/resources/family_preparedness_plan.pdf)

As these events continue to unfold, we recommend that noncitizen
faculty, students, and staff who believe that they may be similarly
targeted by the federal government take the following precautionary
measures:

1. Contact an immigration attorney who has experience with deportation
defense. For recommendations, you may consider contacting your local
chapter or affiliate of the [National Lawyers
Guild](https://www.nlg.org/chapters/), [American Civil Liberties
Union](https://www.aclu.org/affiliates), or [Council on
American-Islamic
Relations](https://www.cair.com/about_cair/cair-chapters/).

2. Review [your
rights](https://immigrantjustice.org/know-your-rights/ice-encounter). You
are under no legal obligation to open the door to immigration
authorities absent a JUDICIAL WARRANT (that is, a warrant signed by a
judge). Please familiarize yourself with the difference between a
judicial warrant and an administrative warrant.

Finally, we call on higher education stakeholders with US citizenship
to close ranks around, and demand that college and university
administrators and governing boards affirmatively protect, our
noncitizen colleagues and students.

We will be in touch with more information in the coming days and
weeks.

In solidarity,

Veena Dubal, General Counsel, AAUP
