The UNC Chapel Hill AAUP chapter is hosting a **UNC Faculty Town Hall
on March 27th**, from 5:30-7pm, at Toy Lounge in [Dey
Hall](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=111#!m/855024) and on Zoom:
<https://unc.zoom.us/j/98329777299>

UNC faculty are facing increasing political interference in our
teaching, research, and university governance. This open forum will
provide a space for faculty to share concerns, discuss challenges, and
strategize collective action. **Open to all UNC facultyâ€”bring your
questions and concerns!**

Legal experts from UNC and the AAUP will be on hand to moderate
questions and offer perspective. Join fellow faculty members for an
open discussion on the issues affecting our work, our students, and
the future of higher education.

Please circulate the [flyer for the
event](/assets/aaup-town-hall-flyer-march-27.pdf) widely. Thanks to
member Chris Petsko for designing the flyer!
