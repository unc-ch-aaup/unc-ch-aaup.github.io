Today the UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP sent the following statement to interim President Roper, the Board of Trustees, and the Board of Governors:

> Since 1920, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has advocated for “meaningful faculty participation in institutional governance,” including all important “personnel decisions” and the “selection of administrators” (https://www.aaup.org/our-programs/shared-governance). The UNC Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP urges interim President Roper, the Board of Governors and our Board of Trustees to return to the AAUP core principle of shared governance at our campus. Specifically, we insist that faculty should be at the table in the selection process for both the interim chancellor and the new permanent chancellor. This would enable faculty to move forward with confidence in our leadership and in the continued viability of shared governance between the faculty, administrators and Boards. Vital governance structures are in a state of disrepair at Chapel Hill and throughout the UNC system; including faculty in the selection of UNC Chapel Hill's next chancellor would be an important first step in carrying out the repair work that needs to be done. We understand that this matter is time-sensitive, but nothing should preclude the immediate inclusion of faculty in the making of this crucial decision.
