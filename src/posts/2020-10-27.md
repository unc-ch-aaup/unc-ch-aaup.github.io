title: Open meeting regarding Spring semester - Friday 10/30 at noon
---

As many of our departments are scheduling next semester's courses, and
crucial decisions for Spring are being made, the UNC-CH chapter of the
AAUP invites all UNC students, employees, and community members to an
open meeting on **Friday, Oct. 30th from Noon - 1:30pm EDT**.

UNC's plan to reopen campuses for the start of the Fall semester was
fundamentally flawed and doomed to fail. Across the U.S., young adults
ages 18 to 22 saw a 55% increase nationally in Covid-19 cases in
August. And now, in North Carolina, hospitalization rates are the
highest since July. This meeting will provide a space to share
concerns and experiences and to exchange ideas, and we will hear brief
reports from the working groups (Strategy, Finance, Governance) that
emerged from our open meetings this summer.

This fall the groups have developed a detailed analysis of UNC's
budgets and governance, titled “Another UNC is Possible.” A summary
statement will be discussed at the meeting.

UNC’s financial crisis did not begin with Covid-19, and now that we're
facing economic losses as a result of the pandemic, new approaches—to
the Spring semester and beyond—are needed.

Please distribute widely. All UNC students, employees, and community
neighbors are welcome.
