### UNC Audit Analysis Presentation

#### Thursday, 11/13 @ 5:30 pm, Kerr Hall 1001

Please join us in person or virtually to receive the findings from
Howard Bunsis's independent audit of UNC finances. Bunsis's analysis
equips us with data to challenge ServiceFirst austerity measures to
reduce faculty and staff numbers, salaries, and benefits.

The presentation begins at 5:30 pm and will be followed by a Q&A. The
main entrance to Kerr will be unlocked until 5:45, though facilitators
will be available to let you in if you're arriving late.

The event is especially exciting as it represents a collaborative
effort between UE 150 (grad students and staff workers), UNC-AAUP
(us), and TransparUNCy (undergraduates).

### No Compact for Higher Ed at UNC

[After the rally Friday led by Sunrise UNC and other student groups,
Chancellor Roberts said at the Faculty Council meeting that afternoon
that UNC would not agree to the Trump administration's Compact for
Higher
Ed.](https://www.wral.com/news/education/unc-chapel-hill-rejects-trump-education-compact-november-2025/)
See [the statement we distributed at the
meeting](/assets/aaup-vs-compact.pdf).

### No new accreditor for UNC (at least for now) 

At the Faculty Council meeting, Provost Dean said UNC-CH would go with
the same accreditor in 2027, rather than [switching to
CPHE](https://www.theassemblync.com/education/unc-cphe-college-accreditation/),
which met with applause. Last week the UNC-Charlotte AAUP chapter
published this powerful [letter to the
editor](https://www.ninertimes.com/opinion/letter-to-the-editor-prevent-the-floridification-of-north-carolina-accreditation/article_0ea23377-0195-459d-8af3-7571d106cb68.html)
outlining the stakes of the CPHE.

### Discriminating Against Dissent
