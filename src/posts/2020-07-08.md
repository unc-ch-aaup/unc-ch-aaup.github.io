title: Off Ramp Now meeting July 9 at 12 noon
---

Since Maria DeGuzman and Michael Palm sent [the petition signed by UNC instructors](https://unc-ch-aaup.org/covid-19-petition) to the Chancellor and Provost, our AAUP chapter has hosted two meetings open to anyone at UNC concerned about the administration's “roadmap” for this fall. Working groups were established to focus on: campus workers, graduate students, undergraduates, a cross-campus network, the Chapel Hill community, and the press.
 
**We're holding the next ’big group’ meeting on Thursday, July 9 from noon to 1:30pm, via Zoom.**

AAUP meetings are open to all UNC-CH faculty and instructors, including graduate students. For the Zoom meeting ID and password, please email info@unc-ch-aaup.org or DM [@unc_ch_aaup](https://twitter.com/unc_ch_aaup), or contact one of the officers below.
 
Please reach out to one of the AAUP officers with questions, etc.
