title: National AAUP President calls for explanation on UNC–Chapel Hill tenure delay
---

In a statement released today, national AAUP President Todd Wolfson
congratulated the thirty-three faculty members in the College of Arts
and Sciences and professional schools who finally received a tenure
vote, after having been denied one without announcement or explanation
by the UNC–Chapel Hill Board of Trustees.

Wolfson notes that the state of academic freedom and faculty
governance at North Carolina’s flagship school, the first public
university in the United States, is now in question:

> The thirteen-member UNC–Chapel Hill Board of Trustees … has
> significant work to do to repair the damage to academic freedom and
> the reputation of the university. Faculty members and their
> departments, who expected a transparent and honest tenure review,
> deserve answers to their questions: Why didn’t the board approve
> these faculty members in March? Why were humanities, social
> sciences, and professional school faculty targeted? What will be
> done to ensure this kind of delay does not happen again?
