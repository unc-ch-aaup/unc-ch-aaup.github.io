title: UNC-CH AAUP statement on recording of teaching
---

The UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the AAUP condemns the secret recording
of any instructors for any purpose. This practice violates ethical
standards and the law. The “prevailing academic practice,” according
to the national AAUP’s surveying of colleges and Universities across
the United States, deems [faculty as the copyright owners of their
teaching content][1]. As such, recording the teaching of any content by
any instructors for any purpose without their consent violates that
principle and copyright law. Furthermore, UNC’s own policy states: [“A
classroom recording should not be used for any purpose except to meet
the educational objectives of that particular class.”][2] (See also
[UNC's policy on “Recording Classes Best Practices.”][3])
