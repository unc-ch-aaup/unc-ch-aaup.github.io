Our final chapter meeting of the 2018-19 academic year will be held on Friday, April 12th, from noon to 1pm, in [Alumni Hall](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=111#!m/372899) Room 205. 

Among other topics, we plan to discuss search for a new Chancellor, the Faculty Council transition and appointing AAUP representatives, and the current climate on campus.

Please spread the word to interested colleaguesâ€”you do not need to be an AAUP member to attend.
