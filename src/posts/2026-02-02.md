### Academic Freedom Code for UNC System

Last week the UNC System Board of Governors "[unanimously approved the
System's academic freedom
definition](https://www.wunc.org/education/2026-01-28/nc-professors-fear-new-academic-freedom-policy-censor-faculty),"
which seeks to set
"[limits](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2026/01/29/unc-plans-define-what-academic-freedom-and-isnt)"
on academic freedom, and put it forward for a binding vote at their
next meeting on Feb. 25th. The NC AAUP's Syllabus Committee (including
members from our chapter) will communicate a statewide strategy in
advance of the BoG mtg.

You can read [the proposed revised
policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y5uv1atZ6xoUiToNH_UcvswTWsXmB1prhZDZo1fif80/edit?tab=t.0). Be
sure to note the "system suggestions in red."

See the attached letter from AAUP's lawyers to UNC System about the
proposed policy revisions. **Please circulate this letter widely.**

### Syllabus Requests

**If you receive a public records request for a syllabus, please share
it -- and any subsequent correspondence -- with the NC AAUP hotline at
[https://www.aaupnc.org/projects/providing-legal-support](https://www.aaupnc.org/projects/providing-legal-support).**

The hotline can confidentially provide support and first-line legal
advice. Compiling as much info as possible will also help us build a
legal case against the UNC system and the syllabus policy.

**Please also continue to share with colleagues the NC AAUP's
"[Guidelines for
Syllabi](https://www.aaupnc.org/projects/guidance-for-syllabi)," and
encourage them to share with the hotline any requests they receive.**

### Duke AAUP Cut the Cuts Rally

#### Friday Feb. 6th, 4:30pm, Duke East Campus

UNC CH AAUP, UE150, and TransparUNCy are collaborating with Duke and
several other organizations for a Durham-based Cut the Cuts
rally. This is an opportunity for cross institutional solidarity in
the face of ideological cuts to staff and services at public and
private universities. (Following our lead, our AAUP colleagues at Duke
commissioned their own independent audit). Please consider joining
this Friday, February 6th at Trinity Park in Durham, 4:30 pm. Please
circulate the attached flyer. [More

### Area Studies Centers closings

The Faculty Executive Council passed [this
resolution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ExcLLP89V1BA8P2yHY63dD1Ndoi4m5d/view)
in support of the centers.

### Chapter Organizing

Our chapter has formed a **faculty governance working group**. The
committee will continue to report at our Friday meetings.

We are looking for a few **volunteers to run our chapter elections**,
slated for April. Election committee members are responsible for
soliciting nominations for officer terms beginning in June and running
the election. **If you do not plan to run for office and would like to
be involved, please email Rosie Miesner:
[rose.miesner@gmail.com](mailto:rose.miesner@gmail.com)**

Several of our chapter members are participating in the **National
AAUP "Organize Every Campus" training in February 2026.** If you are
looking for ways to join other colleagues to more effectively resist
the far right's and UNC's violations of academic freedom, threats of
violence and harassment, this training could be for you!

"Organize Every Campus" training will take place over 5 sessions on
**Mondays and Wednesdays, February 2, 4, 9, 11 and 18, from 6:30
PM-8:30 PM ET**. Participants are expected to attend the entire
training for all five sessions, since each session builds on the
previous ones. In order to sign up, you do not have to register
directly. **Email Don Nonini at
[dnonini@gmail.com](mailto:dnonini@gmail.com) you are interested in
participating in these sessions, or have questions.**

**Our next weekly working meeting will be Friday, January 30th, from Noon-1pm.**

All UNC instructors are welcome to attend, to help strategize about
the area studies closures, the syllabus policy, academic freedom, and
to bring other issues for us to discuss as well.
