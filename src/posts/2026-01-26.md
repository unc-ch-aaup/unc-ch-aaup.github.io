### Syllabus Requests, Committee, and Q&A Sessions

If you receive a public records request for a syllabus, please share
it with the NC AAUP hotline at
<https://www.aaupnc.org/projects/providing-legal-support> The hotline
can confidentially provide support and first-line legal advice.
Compiling as much info as possible will also help us build a legal
case against the UNC system and the syllabus policy.

The NC AAUP Syllabus Committee has scheduled three Zoom meetings at
different times, hopefully accommodating different schedules, to field
questions live:

* **Monday, January 26 from 5-6 PM** (one of our attorneys will be
present at this one)
* **Friday, January 30 from 9-10 AM**
* **Monday, February 2 from 1-2 PM**

Please register for the first meeting here:

If you are interested in joining the NC AAUP Syllabus Committee,
contact Michael Palm [mwpalm@gmail.com](mailto:mwpalm@gmail.com).

### Academic Freedom Code for UNC System and Working Group

The UNC System Board of Governors is [poised to define—and
restrict—academic freedom][1]. You can read [the proposed revised
policy][2]. Be sure to note the “system suggestions in red.”

If you would like to join a group working to protect academic freedom
at UNC-Chapel Hill, contact Michael Palm at
[mwpalm@gmail.com](mailto:mwpalm@gmail.com).

### Faculty Governance Interest Survey and Working Group

If you would like to join a working group of chapter members
interested in working with faculty governance groups, contact Mehdi
Shadmehr: [mshadmeh@gmail.com](mailto:mshadmeh@gmail.com)

Faculty governance interest survey closes tomorrow (Tuesday) at
midnight. Though the administration is undermining faculty governance
at every opportunity, these positions provide a public venue for
expressing collective concerns and registering resistance. Please
consider registering your interest in participating. No blood
sacrifice required, you will have a chance to change your mind before
April elections. Search your UNC inbox for "Reminder to take the
Faculty Governance Interest Survey."

### Election Committee Volunteers

We are looking for a few volunteers to run our chapter elections,
slated for April. Election committee members are responsible for
soliciting nominations for officer terms beginning in June and running
the election. If you do not plan to run for office and would like to
be involved, please email Rosie Miesner:
[rose.miesner@gmail.com](mailto:rose.miesner@gmail.com)

### Chapter Organizing

**Our next weekly working meeting will be Friday, January 30th, from Noon-1pm.**

All UNC instructors are welcome to attend, to help strategize about
the area studies closures, the syllabus policy, academic freedom, and
to bring other issues for us to discuss as well.

Wednesdays, February 2, 4, 9, 11 and 18, from 6:30 PM-8:30 PM
