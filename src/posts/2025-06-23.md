UNC-CH AAUP chapter president Michael Palm sat down with 97.9 The
Hillâ€™s Aaron Keck to discuss the fight for tenure at UNC. The [UNC-CH
chapter and statewide NC
AAUP](/assets/aaup-letter-to-bot-2025-06-05.pdf) and the [national
AAUP
president](https://www.aaup.org/news/aaup-president-calls-explanation-unc-chapel-hill-tenure-delay)
have called on the UNC Board of Trustees to provide more transparency
and a full explanation after an unusual months-long delay in approving
tenure applications for dozens of faculty members earlier this year.
