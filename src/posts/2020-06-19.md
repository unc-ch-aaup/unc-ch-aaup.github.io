We will hold another meeting (via Zoom) next **Thursday, June 25, from noon to 1:15PM Eastern time**. The Zoom meeting ID and password are the same as last week's meeting.

Time will be devoted in the meeting for working groups focused on: faculty-grad student collaboration; outreach to all campus workers, other campus constituencies, and the Chapel Hill community; and working with the press. 

Please contact one of the AAUP officers with other suggestions for working groups or to get involved, and please spread the word to interested colleagues. 

AAUP meetings are open to all UNC-CH faculty and instructors, including graduate students. For the Zoom meeting ID and password, please email info@unc-ch-aaup.org or DM [@unc_ch_aaup](https://twitter.com/unc_ch_aaup), or contact one of the officers below.
