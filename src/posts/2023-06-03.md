title: UNC faculty oppose legislative overreach
---

Over 600 UNC-Chapel Hill faculty have signed a letter ([original](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2023/04/opinion-letter-to-editor-aaup-campus-politics-intervention), [archived copy](/assets/unc-faculty-oppose-legislative-overreach.pdf)) condemning the interference and overreach of the North Carolina legislature, the UNC System Board of Governors, and the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees whose actions violate the principles of academic freedom and shared governance that undergird higher education in N.C. and the U.S. If enacted, we believe that these measures will further damage the reputation of UNC and the state of North Carolina and will likely bring critical scrutiny from accrediting agencies that know undue interference in university affairs when they see it.
