### Faculty First Responders Resources

Last week we had an informative workshop with Heather from Faculty
First Responders. See below for some resources on digital
security, academic freedom, and building institutional responses to
support colleagues. Please be on the lookout for a digital security
workshop with Heather next semester. *Hearty thanks to Rosie Meisner
for your initiative, hard work and leadership!*

### Academic Freedom Resources 

See below for a 2-page flyer about academic freedom. We're working on
additional materials to circulate to colleagues about how to respond
to attacks against your academic freedom. If you would like to help
with these materials, contact Abbey Hatcher at
abbeyhatcher@gmail.com. *Hearty thanks to Abbey for your initiative,
hard work, and leadership!*

And stay tuned for more details about an academic freedom hotline that
will be answered by attorneys from Stevens, Martin, Vaughn and Tadych,
North Carolina's leading First Amendment firm, and from their
partners. The hotline will address academic freedom problems and
questions faced by faculty and then help faculty consider their
options, including legal representation. The hotline will be available
to all faculty. Stevens, Martin, Vaughn and Tadych has for many years
staffed a hotline for the North Carolina Press Association and
assisted journalists around the state with First Amendment
violations. We plan to share phone and email information soon.

### Chapter Grant

We secured a grant of $7500 from AAUP National. $4000 of these funds
will complement UE 150's efforts to fund a private audit of the
university. We anticipate that the audit will be completed by the end
of October. Remaining funds will support the legal hotline and member
recruitment efforts. *Hearty thanks to Rosie Meisner for your
initiative, hard work, and leadership!*

### Meet our New Organizers!

The NC AAUP has hired an organizer, Audrey Berlowitz, and the national
AAUP has assigned two organizers, Brian Allen and Jawuanna McAlister,
to work with NC chapters. They've been a big help this Fall. Look out
for them at future events.

Audrey Berlowitz (augustbaum56@gmail.com) has degrees in women's
studies, Continental philosophy, and the politics of higher
education. She became a higher education activist during the 2023-2024
UNCG program cuts induced by the NC board of governor's new austerity
measures. As an AAUP NC organizer, she aims to work with others to
build AAUP membership across chapters while simultaneously building
organizing skills within membership. She is especially interested in
figuring out how to adopt and adapt union power-building strategies to
non-collective bargaining contexts.

Brian Allen (he/him, ballen@aaup.org) is originally from Georgia and
now resides in Queens. He was introduced to the labor movement in 2013
as a Teamster at the Atlanta airport. Before joining AAUP in April, he
worked with several unions, including United Campus Workers, IUE-CWA,
and the Association of Legal Advocates and Attorneys. Most recently,
he was a staff organizer with UAW Local 7902, supporting adjunct
faculty, academic student workers, student health workers, and
resident assistants at NYU and The New School in collective
bargaining.
