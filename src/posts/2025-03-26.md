title: AAUP lawsuits against the Trump regime
---

The AAUP has joined up with the AFT to sue the Trump administration
over the unlawful funding cuts at Columbia:

> [*This action challenges the Trump administration’s unlawful and
unprecedented effort to overpower a university’s academic autonomy and
control the thought, association, scholarship, and expression of its
faculty and
students.*](https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AAUP-AFT-v-DOJ-Complaint.pdf)

The AAUP has also joined with the Middle East Studies Association,
AAUP-NYU, AAUP Rutgers, and AAUP Harvard in a separate suit that
alleges that the constitutional rights of US citizen faculty are being
violated by the Trump Administration’s immigration policies which
suppress the speech of non-citizen faculty and students:

> [*Plaintiffs are associations whose members include thousands of
faculty and students at universities across the country.  They
commence this action because the ideological-deportation policy, and
the repressive climate it has engendered, has far-reaching
implications for the expressive and associational rights of their
U.S. citizen members, and for Plaintiffs themselves. The policy
prevents or impedes Plaintiffs’ U.S.  citizen members from hearing
from, and associating with, their noncitizen students and
colleagues.*](https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/pwkvocf6z4)

Updates on both suits and other actions will be coming from the
national leadership.
