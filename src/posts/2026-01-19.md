### TODAY: Protecting Noncitizens, 5-6pm

AAUP NC has organized an info session for Monday, January 19, 5-6 pm,
about ways to protect the rights of noncitizen faculty, students, and
staff on our campuses. We'll hear from AAUP senior counsel Aaron
Nisenson; and learn from faculty members about models and plans for
protecting noncitizens on campus, as well as where and how to work
with local groups, such as Siembra NC, in the broader community. We'll
also talk about how to pressure/encourage university administrations
to better communicate with and protect their noncitizen communities.
