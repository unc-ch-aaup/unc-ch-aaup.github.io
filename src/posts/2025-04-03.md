title: Notes from the UNC Faculty Town Hall (27 March 2025)
---

On Thursday, 3/27/25 the UNC AAUP held a hybrid meeting for concerned
members of the UNC community (AAUP member or not) about the current
attacks on higher education. While there were suggested topics of
conversation, the attendees focused on how to be proactive in
protecting UNC community members from ICE raids.

#### Invited guests

AAUP Vice-President Rotua Lumbantobing and Osamudia James, UNC Law
Professor and co-signer of [this
memo](https://app.box.com/s/2me4mszr6p4oinnucw8i4jmb8d7570kp) to
university OGCs explaining the lawfulness of DEI programs. (VP
Lumbantobing was unable to join via zoom.)

#### Summary of key next steps

- Two working groups formed, focused on “Information and Resources”
  and “Emergency Support” for students, faculty and staff
  at-risk. Email <mwpalm@gmail.com> to join either.
- Most immediately, attendees wanted **clarity from the university**
  about what counts **as private space** on campus that ICE agents
  can’t enter without a warrant. The Faculty Senate has already raised
  this issue but hasn’t gotten a clear answer.
- Share best practices for keeping UNC community members safe from ICE
  and other forces of policing on campus
- Create a way to keep in touch with members who attended the
  meeting. Email <info@unc-ch-aaup.org> if you want to join or organize
  a task force or if you want to join the UNC Chapter of the
  AAUP. Email Michael Palm, <mwpalm@gmail.com>, if you want to be on the
  AAUP listserv. You don’t have to be a member of the AAUP to be on
  the listserv.
- Join with other local organizations, like
  [TransparUNCy](https://www.instagram.com/transparuncy/) (undergrad
  activist group worth following) and [UE Local
  150](https://www.workersunionunc.com/), which are advocating for
  similar causes.

We have to support one another to stay vocal and co-create the
leadership and community we are seeking.

We need to both donate to and show up for local chapters of groups
like NAACP, Men for Racial Justice, and other grassroots community
groups.

#### Questions and answers

##### Q1. Why join the AAUP?

- AAUP files lawsuits that defend higher education and protect faculty
- AAUP protects academic freedom. [The organization was founded in
  1915 to define and defend academic freedom, a role it continues to
  play](https://www.aaup.org/about/history-aaup).
- **Note**: State law prohibits North Carolina employees from
  collective bargaining, giving state employees fewer rights and
  protections than most other states. However, we do have the right to
  unionize.
- AAUP protects promotion and tenure rights through its [Committee on
  Academic Freedom and Tenure (Committee
  A)](https://www.aaup.org/about/committees) and [the policies it has
  affirmed dating back to its founding in
  1915](https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure/resources-tenure).
- The AAUP and professional organizations are providing leadership
  right now that the university isn’t.
- **Note**: The dues to join are expensive but 1. You can pay in
  monthly installments and 2. The national AAUP gives a lot of money
  back to the state AAUP to use locally.

##### Q2. Who, if anyone, is organizing with staff?

- [UE Local 150](https://www.workersunionunc.com/) is the union for
  staff at UNC and graduate student workers. Staff members often
  attend meetings that faculty organize. Not sure about grad student
  workers.
- **Note**: Staff are particularly vulnerable, especially if their
  positions are dependent on grants.

##### Q3. What are other tactics can we use besides filing lawsuits to resist the attack on higher education?

- Join the planned **Days of Action** organized by the AAUP
  - [April 8](https://www.killthecuts.org/) Day of Action: Kill the Cuts
  - [April 17](https://www.dayofactionforhighered.org/) Day of Action
    for Higher Ed
- Share collectively sourced information about best practices that
  been effective in defending our rights
- Compile and share information about which federal grants have been
  cut at so that we can raise awareness about the harms the cuts have
  caused and gauge the extent of the cuts. **To do: Create a local to
  UNC list of cancelled grants to supplement what’s already
  available. Can be crowdsourced.**
  - [Here are guidelines about what to do if your federal grant is
  ended](https://www.sssp1.org/index.cfm/pageid/2626?fbclid=IwY2xjawJT2wVleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHbeQkXOi4Ae0KYqtdAzJeNzaDRTlwreejsYpmxD38LB9STxzArzV5Dvvmw_aem_LSTQjpZeSgDfFW8oOFnyeA)
  - [Here is a report from Department of Health and Human Services and
  the NIH listing grants that have been terminated as of
  3/21/25](https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf).

##### Q4. What can do to protect people targeted by ICE, especially immigrants and other people with precarious citizenship status? Relatedly, how do we protect rights of protestors?

- [AAUP and the Middle East Studies Association (MESA) had a know
   your rights webinar on
   3-27-25](https://mesana.org/resources-and-opportunities/2025/03/21/trumps-immigration-actions-what-to-know-webinar)
- When talking to UNC administration or with ICE agents, emphasize
  your Fourth Amendment Right to be protected from unreasonable search
  and seizure. Stand up for other people if you see them being
  attacked by ICE.
- Get trained by Siembra NC about how to protect people from ICE
  raids. Go to a training, join or volunteer at Siembra, and [download
  this playbook](https://defendandrecruit.org/) from them about what
  to do defend immigrants. Also helpful: [Upstander
  Training.](https://righttobe.org/events/bystander-intervention-to-support-the-immigrant-community-3/)
- Federal law says that ICE can’t enter **private spaces** without a
  judicial warrant signed by a judge. So far, UNC has established that
  dorms are private spaces that ICE can’t enter without a warrant if
  the entry is locked. **To do**: Get UNC to define what other spaces
  on campus count as private spaces. For instance, offices seem like
  they should be considered private spaces.

##### Q5. What is the AAUP and other members of campus doing to protect grad students of color who are being targeted for speaking up to support Palestine?

- Organizing protests like last year’s encampments and doing other
  forms of direct actions are still options
- **Note**: Some grad students who are immigrants are afraid to travel
  home, travel to other states, or move around on campus because they
  are afraid of being abducted (this includes students with legal
  status).

##### Q6. Has the UNC AAUP expressed concerns about ICE raids to the administration?

- No, because UNC AAUP, as a small organization, is not big enough to
  meet independently with the administration. This moment is a chance
  to join the AAUP and shape the organization the way you want to see
  it. The AAUP is us.

- We also can build power by connecting with the other AAUPs across
  North Carolina and organizing with them.

#### Comments

- **On how to think about the current moment**:
  - We can’t be quiet now because these times are like the height of Jim
Crow segregation in the 1940s and 1950s.
  - As academics, it’s uncomfortable for some of us to confront this
moment because we are not used to consciously being involved in
political struggles. Acknowledge your discomfort and privilege that
may have shielded you from recognizing the political stakes of higher
education before. What privilege are you willing to give up to
confront the moment?
  - Acknowledge how the government’s attacks are rooted in white
supremacy and other forms of oppression.
- **On supporting legal defense orgs**: Donate to legal
  organizations. Though legal defense can’t be our only strategy, the
  progressive legal organizations have rapidly mounted a defense
  against political attacks and are stretched thin. Some organizations
  to support: [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/), [the Center for
  Constitutional Rights](https://ccrjustice.org/), and [Just
  Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/).
- **On ICE Raids**:
  - We should get training on how to protect people in case of ICE
raids, for instance, developing a trusted, verified warning system if
ICE is on campus. **Call Siembra’s hotline to report suspected ICE
raids 336-543-0353. Confirm with Siembra if the ICE raid is real
before sharing the information** **in your network**.
  - Get the university to clarify what counts as public and private
space on campus.
  - Create a network of people to provide refuge from ICE.
  - Join other local social organizations that have already been doing
this work and learn from their expertise. Follow their lead.
  - Create a buddy system where people walk people who may be targeted home.
  - Direct action to interrupt people who ICE is kidnapping: filming,
asking for signed warrant from judge, asking them to identify
themselves.
  - Lock classroom doors to slow ICE from entering.
  - Recognize that some immigrant communities have their own networks of
keeping informed about ICE. Yet, not all immigrants are plugged into
those communities, especially international students.
- **On organizing against funding cuts**:
  - Stand up for each other because the government is cutting our
funding regardless of our discipline
  - The grad workers union hired an independent auditor to study the
financial health of UNC. The auditor found that UNC has plenty of
money to operate and cuts aren’t warranted based on the funding they
had before the federal government’s attacks.
- **General ideas for organizing and next steps**
  - Create a rapid response playbook if something happens on campus. For
instance, staging mass walkouts.
  - Create regular meetings of task forces based on the various threats
to higher education: ICE and immigration, resegregation and anti-DEI,
attacks on protest especially pro-Palestinian protest, defunding of
higher education, anti-trans attacks
  - Improve communication and coordination between faculty and student
organizations on campus.
  - Return to analog technology like phone trees and in-person meetings.
  - Support different modes of resistance, including direct action.
  - Join other local organizations that doing this work such as
[NAACP](https://www.chapelhillcarrboronaacp.com/) and
[SURJ](https://surj.org/our-work/chapters/) (a white anti-racist
organization)
  - Do community care by checking in on how other people are doing and
connecting with other people as well as self-care.
  - Create a secure way to communicate with each other.
  - Finds ways to proactively support students who have been visible in
their support of Palestine against attack by the government.
  - **Note**: Be careful about putting vulnerable groups, like
immigrants and/or people of color in danger when trying to help
them. Ask how to best to helpful.
