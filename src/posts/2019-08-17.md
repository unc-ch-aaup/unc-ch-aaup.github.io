title: August chapter meeting / NC AAUP Conference
---
Our first AAUP chapter meeting of the academic year will be on Friday, August 30th, from noon to 1pm in Toy Lounge (4th floor of [Dey Hall](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=111#!m/104740)). Please spread the word and invite interested colleagues.

We'll forge an agenda for the year, which presumably will include addressing the UNC administration's accelerating plans for a [Program for Civic Virtue and Civil Discourse](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2019/06/faculty-executive-committee-june), intended to have influence over the curriculum as well as programming. An advisory committee has been appointed, and [Robert George](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article190101624.html) has been hired as its Chair, for which he'll be paid $20k. George is Director of the [James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions](https://jmp.princeton.edu) at Princeton, the leading conservative “beachhead” within higher ed.

**And please save the date:**

Our chapter is hosting the annual conference of the [NC statewide AAUP](https://aaupnorthcarolina.wordpress.com) on October 4th and 5th.

AAUP President Rudy Fichtenbaum will give a keynote address on the evening of the 4th, and Saturday the 5th will feature a presentation and workshop with a representative from the organization [UnKoch My Campus](http://www.unkochmycampus.org).
