title: AAUP surveys of executive order impact
---

The national American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is
currently conducting two surveys to understand the impact of recent
executive orders on AAUP members, in order to see who is affected and
may have standing for a lawsuit. These surveys are confidential, but
not anonymous.

1. The first survey aims to understand [the impact of funding cuts made
by DOGE][1].
2. The second survey aims to understand [the impact of two executive
   orders claiming to combat terrorism and anti-Semitism.][2]

The AAUP is also looking for:

1. Examples of grant funding that have been paused or terminated due
   to executive orders issued since January 20, 2025.
2. Examples of changes to programs, teaching, research, titles,
   etc. linked to either the [Dear Colleague letter][3] or to the
   executive orders.

Email these to Aaron Nisenson, Senior Counsel at the AAUP at
anisenson@aaup.org.
