title: UNC-CH AAUP statement on UNC chancellor searches
---

The UNC-Chapel Hill chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is opposed to the current policy of allowing the UNC System President to name a finalist candidate for chancellor searches at UNC campuses.

The Board of Governors’ recent [appointment of Darrell Allison as Chancellor at Fayetteville State University](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2021/03/university-fsu-chancellor-controversy)—after a normal search had created an initial list of finalists that did not include him—demonstrates that the current system is in violation of the AAUP’s principles of shared campus governance.
